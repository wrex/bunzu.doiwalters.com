Diagrams are intentionally very simple. You don't need any fancy software to
create them. The intent is to be able to create them with nothing more than a
pencil and paper (or chalk and chalkboard).

## Write the original sentence

The first step couldn't be easier: Simply write the original sentence you plan
to diagram at the top of the page.

Optionally, you can also write an English _transliteration_ for the sentence
immediately below the original.

## Draw lines for clauses

Every sentence (in any language) has at least one clause (compound sentences
might have multiple).

Every {文節}^(ぶんせつ) (clause) has a {主語}^(しゅご) (subject) and a {述語}^(じゅつご)
(predicate). There can be many words (including complete clauses/phrases) that
modify each of these, but at the core of the sentence there will always be a {体言}^(たいげん)
acting as the subject, and a {用言}^(ようげん) acting as the predicate.

First draw a horizontal line. This will act as a baseline for the subject and
predicate to rest on.

Then draw a vertical line to separate the subject from the predicate. This line
should extend above and below the baseline, and should be positioned somewhere
central.

Then write the _core_ 主語 to the left of the separator, and the core 述語
to the right.

Let's start with an extremely simple example:

<Diagram filename="hanagasaku.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {花}^(はな)が{咲}^(さ)く
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">[The] flower blooms</p>
</Diagram>

In English, this means "The flower blooms". English wants the definite article
"the" but there is no equivalent word in the original sentence, so we put it in
square brackets to indicate that it was added.

There's obviously only one clause, with single words for each part of that clause:

- The 主語 is the single word 花 (identified by the particle が). 花 is the master
  doing the action.

- The 述語 is the single verb 咲く. The action is "blooms".

There are a few things to notice:

- If you ignore any lines or symbols and simply _read_ what's on the baseline, you get the
  core clause 「花が咲く」. (The core clause happens to be the entire sentence in this
  example, but that obviously won't always be the case!)

- The particle が is explicitly included with the 主語 since it's literally
  present in the original sentence (が identifies subjects).

### Other {用言}^(ようげん)

The 述語 (predicate) won't always be a 動詞 (verb). It could also be 形容詞
(is-verb) or 形容動詞 (だ is-verb). Consider, for example, the sentences:

<Diagram filename="watashiganemui.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {私}^(わたし)が{眠}^(ねむ)い
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">I am-sleepy</p>
</Diagram>

<Diagram filename="karegashizukada.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {彼}^(かれ)が{静}^(しず)かだ
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">He is-quiet</p>
</Diagram>

Note in particular that the predicate in that last example is 静かだ and _not_ just
だ. English speakers might want to think of だ as a single-word verb like the
English word "is", but だ on its own is _not_ a "freestanding" word. Neither is
静か. The 用言 is 静かだ.

### _Transliteration_ not translation

The English versions of the last two examples expressly transliterated the 用言
into hyphenated ["is-verbs"](/en/grammar/2-yougen#is-verbs-not-adjectives) ("am-sleepy"
and "is-quiet"). This is to emphasize the fact that these are individual 用言 and
_not_ two separate words.

"Am-sleepy" in the first example corresponds exactly to the single word 眠い.

Similarly, 静かだ becomes the single word "is-quiet".

We attempt to show word-for-word **transliterations** rather than semantic translations.
English often requires us to reorder or add words to keep things
understandable, but transliterating this way reenforces the idea that these
_aren't_ adjectives, they are full predicates all on their own.

### Polite forms

So far we've used plain forms of the verbs. Using polite forms doesn't change
much:

<Diagram filename="hanagasakimasu.svg">
  <p slot="original">花が咲きます</p>
  <p slot="translation">[The] flower blooms (polite)</p>
</Diagram>

<Diagram filename="watashiganemuidesu.svg">
  <p slot="original">私が眠いです</p>
  <p slot="translation">I am-sleepy (polite)</p>
</Diagram>

<Diagram filename="karegashizukadesu.svg">
  <p slot="original">彼が静かです</p>
  <p slot="translation">He is-quiet(polite)</p>
</Diagram>

These are polite forms of 用言, but nothing has changed structurally.

## Implied parts

Japanese sentences can leave out quite a bit and still remain fully grammatical
sentences. The entire subject or part of the predicate can be omitted and the
sentence will still make sense.

### Implied subjects

If all that's given is a 用言, then the subject is implied. As discussed in the
grammar section, [it's helpful to think of the zero pronoun "@" standing in when the
subject is omitted](/en/grammar/7-construction#the-zero-pronoun).

Say, for example, the sentence was simply 「読む」(a verb meaning "read"). It isn't
explicit from the sentence who or what did the reading, so we use the zero
pronoun to stand in for "he" or "she" or "it":

<Diagram filename="yomu.svg">
  <p slot="original">読む</p>
  <p slot="translation">[@] reads</p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- We use "@" to represent the zero pronoun. We use brackets to show that neither
  the @ nor が are literally present in the original sentence.

- The core clause along the baseline is still just the single word _read_ 「読む」 -- the stuff in
  brackets is ignored. [Unless we are talking _about the diagram_ rather than
  about the original sentence. In that case, it's helpful to say「『まるが』読む」 with
  "air quotes" around the first bit.]

- This sentence does _not_ mean "I read", nor does it mean "she reads", nor "it
  reads". Without additional context we simply don't know who or what's
  doing the reading, so we use &ldquo;@&rdquo; to fill in. Note that using the
  zero pronoun this way ensures the diagram remains unchanged no matter the
  context the sentence was used in.

- As always, a clause _must_ have both a subject and a predicate, even if the
  subject is implied and not explicitly present.

### Bare 体言 (implied だ)

As we also discussed
[previously](/en/grammar/7-construction#missing-%E8%BF%B0%E8%AA%9E), one can
create single-word sentences out of 体言. Doing so implies a だ at the end.

For example:

<Diagram filename="ushi.svg">
  <p slot="original">牛</p>
  <p slot="translation">[it] is-cow</p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- Despite all the extra stuff in brackets, this is still a
  _one-word_ sentences. We put things in brackets expressly to make the implied
  stuff _visible_. Structurally speaking, these implied parts are logically
  part of the sentences, but they obviously aren't explicitly present.

- We still skip over everything in brackets when reading the clause along the
  baseline. This clause reads just 「牛」.

- Single words, no matter what part of speech, _must_ be interpreted as 用言 -- 牛
  is part of the _predicate_, not the subject. This can seem odd to English speakers.

- The zero object is the implied subject. There is no way to know
  from the original sentence alone if the subject is "I", "he", "she", or
  "it". The semantic meaning comes from context.

## 修飾語 (Modifiers)

Japanese has a wonderful system of
[助詞](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%98%E3%82%87%E3%81%97-particles) (particles)
that explicitly inform us of what different parts of a sentence are doing. They
tell us if something is specifying a location, a starting point, an ending
point, a means of doing something, etc.

The Japanese word for such modifiers is {修飾語}^(しゅうしょくご). They can
modify any of the eight parts of speech (including other modifiers).

The thing being modified is called {日修飾語}^(ひしゅうしょくご).

These modifiers don't actually change the meaning of the core clause, however.
They just provide more, finer-grained information.

We "hang" modifiers below the things they modify.

### Object modifiers

One particularly interesting modifier is identified by the particle を. It
introduces a grammatical _object_, something the 述語 is acting on or with.

None of the example sentences so far have involved an object, so let's add an
one:

<Diagram filename="honwoyomu.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {本}^(ほん)を{読}^(よ)む
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">[@] reads a book</p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- The original sentence in it's entirety is 「本を読む」, but the _core_
  clause is just 「読む」. It's the same structure we looked at earlier, but "book" just
  adds more information, it tells as _what_ is being read.

- An English _translation_ of that core clause is impossible without more context.
  We still don't know who or what read the book. We don't know whether to use a
  subject of "I", "he", "she", or "it". So we use the magic zero pronoun @
  instead.

- English sentence diagrams have a special notation for objects, but in Japanese
  grammatical objects identified with を are just a modifier like any other
  modifier (as we'll see). We dangle modifiers below whatever they
  modify/qualify.

- Unlike the stuff on the horizontal line (the _core_ of the clause) we don't
  include the particle with the word 本. Instead, we write the particle on the
  stem of the "hanger". This informs us what _type_ of modifying/qualifying is
  going on (sushi is the _grammatical object_ because of the を).

- The "hangers" might look backwards to anyone familiar with English
  (Reed-Kellog) sentence diagrams. Facing them to the left this way with the
  particles on the stem keeps things much more readable.

### Don't add imaginary modifiers

[This overlong section explains why it's okay to add imaginary subjects, but not
okay to add imaginary objects.]

[As we described
earlier](/en/grammar/1-foundations#svo-vs-sov), English is an
"SVO" language. Not only does the verb go in the middle instead of at the end,
English rules _really_ encourage us to include an object, even when it isn't
strictly necessary.

Imagine this exchange between an English-speaking father and son:

> Father: "Who ate the last cookie?"
>
> Son: "I ate **it**."

Notice the word "it" at the end of the son's sentence.

Adding that word would be natural and automatic. Given the context, an
English-speaking son would never reply with just the two words "I ate".[^1] He'd
automatically add the word "it" without conscious thought. Yet the question of
_who_ is fully answered with just "I ate" -- the object is irrelevant.

[^1]:
    Yes, he might answer "I did" because "did" is an intransitive verb that
    doesn't receive an object, but English _really_ wants us to add objects when
    we use verbs like "ate" that are usually transitive.

There _are_ occasionally contexts where we'd use just "I ate" in English (after
being asked, "Did you eat?", for example). Most of the time, though, we
_automatically,_ unconsciously, add at least a pronoun as the object.

_But idiomatic Japanese **often** omits the object!_

In this exact same scenario, a Japanese son might reply with:

> 「私が食べた」

Note that the object "it" is _not_ in the original sentence, but the English
sounds weird without the word "it".

In Japanese, it would actually sound a little weird (not _wrong_, but weird) to
include the object. It would sound wordy and weirdly explicit for the son to say:

> 「私があれを食べた」

or

> 「クーキーを食べた」

when just

> 「食べた」

suffices. Adding 「あれを」or 「クーキーを」would sound weird _even though it is **exactly**
equivalent to "I ate it"._ We already _know_ we're talking about a cookie, so
why bother adding an object? Or even a _subject_? Since the son is talking,
the father would know who did the eating!

How _should_ we diagram the son's reply 「私が食べた」?

English speakers might be tempted to do something like this:

<Diagram filename="watashigaarewotabeta.svg">
  <p slot="original">私が食べた</p>
  <p slot="translation">Bad example -- **DON'T DO THIS**</p>
</Diagram>

But adding an entirely imaginary modifier and particle when there wasn't one in
the original sentence is _incorrect._

A diagram must _not_ invent things that might not have been intended. Sentence
diagrams _must not change just because the surrounding context changes._ The
identical diagram must apply whether the sentence is responding to "Who ate the
last cookie?" or to "Did you eat?". No object would be implied in the latter case.

This sentence should be diagrammed as simply "I ate"
since that is all that's in the original sentence.

It's _English_ rules that make us want to add an explicit object, but we are
diagramming Japanese sentences, so "objectless" sentences are perfectly
acceptable and common even with transitive verbs.

Both Japanese and English clauses _always_ have subjects, but Japanese sentences
especially omit objects quite often.

It's correct and necessary to add imaginary _subjects_ because every 文節 _must_
have a logical subject that we want to make visible, but don't add imaginary
_objects_ or other modifiers to a Japanese sentence diagram. Only diagram the
modifiers that are actually present in the original sentence.

### Other modifiers

Modifiers can affect the subject as well as the predicate. They can even modify
other modifiers:

<Diagram filename="shiroiinugaienonakadeshizukanitabeta.svg">
  <p slot="original">白い犬が家の中で静かに食べた</p>
  <p slot="translation">[The] white dog ate quietly inside the house</p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- The _core_ of this longer sentence is just 「犬が食べてた」.

- Modifiers hang below the things they modify in the same order as they appear
  in the original sentence. The sentence starts with 白い so it attaches to the left
  of the subject.

  Explicit particles in Japanese _allow modifiers to be moved around at will in
  a sentence,_ but in a diagram, they always hang from the things they modify.

  The sentence 「家の中で白い犬が静かに食べた」has precisely the same semantic meaning as the
  original, and **would be diagrammed identically**, despite swapping the order of
  things. The repositioned 家の中で modifier would still hang below the 述語 since
  that's what it modifies.

- We don't attach a particle to the stem for the modifier 白い. 形容詞 can also
  modify 体言 as well as acting as the 述語, but they don't need a particle. They
  always confer a sense of nature or state. So the stem of the first modifier
  remains bare.

  (The word 白い acts as an "adjective" here, but it's still better to consider
  it an example of the 形容詞 part of speech. It's just a modifier like all the
  others.)

- All of the other modifiers have explicit particles indicating what type of
  modifying/qualifying is happening.

  The _location_ is "inside" ([indicated by
  で](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/particle-de/#for-specifying-places)).

  The eating is happening "quietly" ([indicated by
  に](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/particle-ni/#adj---adverb)).

  Western grammarians tend to think of particles like に here _changing_ the
  grammatical function of the "な-adjective" 静か from an adjective into an adverb.

  The author finds it easier to think of 静かだ as _always and forever 形容動詞._ It
  doesn't matter whether it used in a predicate or if the だ is swapped out for
  another particle to indicate some modifying function. It's just a 形容動詞
  specifying a state or condition as always.

  This is the Japanese way to think about the grammar.

- Multiple modifiers affecting the same thing are placed next to each other (中
  で and 静かに both affect the predicate, so they are next to each other on the
  same row).

- Modifiers can also "stack" (modifiers can modify other modifiers). The noun 家
  (いえ, meaning house) is modifying "inside". The particle の indicates which
  particular inside we are talking about.

- Each row of modifiers adds a little more information to the core clause, but
  still forms complete, grammatical sentences:

  - The core clause reads 「犬が食べた」

  - With the next row of modifiers, it reads: 「白い犬が中で静かに食べた」

  - With the final row, we get back to the original sentence: 「白い犬が家の中で静かに食べた」

#### Even verbs can be 修飾語 (modifiers)

Here's an interesting example:

<Diagram filename="arukushuukan.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {歩}^(ある)く{習慣}^(しゅうかん)を{身}^(み)につける
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">[@] acquires the walking habit</p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- The core clause is simply 「つける」(normally this means "[I] attach", but
  here it's closer to "[I] acquire"). The colloquial expression 「身につける」
  means to develop a habit. Literally, it means attaching something to
  your body (effectively making it mindless and automatic).

- Adding one level of modifiers, we get 「習慣をつける」 or "[I] attach
  custom/habit".

- But it's not just any custom/habit, it's specifically the habit of _walking_.
  Note how the modifier here is a pure 動詞 (verb), 歩く.

Here's an even more interesting example of using a verb as a modifier,

<Diagram filename="hayakuokiru.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {早}^(はや)く{起}^(お)きるように{努力}^(どりょく)する
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">[@] endeavors to early-wake</p>
</Diagram>

We'd translate this into English as something like "I endeavor to wake early",
but structurally that is _very_ different than the literal Japanese. This
English translation is a compound sentence that uses "wake" as a verb.

In the Japanese sentence, 起きる (wake) is a _modifier_, what we'd call an
"adverb" in English, affecting 努力する ("to endeavor") which itself is a
動詞 (a verb, albeit a special kind of "suru" verb).

Notes:

- The core clause is simply 「努力する」("[@] endeavors").

- 「起きる」is a 動詞, a verb, but with the「〜ように」here, it's acting as 修飾語 (a modifier,
  effectively an adverb).

- Further, 「早く」is also acting to modify/qualify the verb 起きる.

### Conjugations/inflections

Japanese grammar has [an amazing number of ways to conjugate or inflect
verb stems](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conjugation-groups/).

It's all quite logical once you get used to it, but you can combine the rules in
many ways to fold, spindle, or mutilate the dictionary form verbs in
amazingly complex ways.

From a diagramming perspective, though, with few exceptions a verb is just a
verb, no matter how complex it becomes.

English doesn't have a single word that means "did not want to be made to read",
but Japanese _does_! (To be more precise: Japanese has a way to
conjugate/inflect an individual verb to mean that, but English requires
several additional words and sentence restructuring to communicate the same idea.)

<Diagram filename="yoma-etc.svg">
  <p slot="original">本を読まさせられたくなかった</p>
  <p slot="translation">[@] did-not-want-to-be-made-to-read [a] book</p>
</Diagram>

That ridiculous verb is still just a single inflection of a single verb with the
plain form 読む (to read).
