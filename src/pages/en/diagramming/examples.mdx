better place to put them.

## 連用形 (continuative form)

There are six forms of inflection for Japanese verbs. One form is called 連用形
or "continuative" form.

This form is usually followed by some form of suffix:

- {助動詞}^(じょどうし) (auxiliary verbs), e.g.

  - た (だ)
  - たい
  - ます
  - そうだ

- {助詞}^(じょし) (particles), e.g.
  - て (で)
  - ても
  - たり
  - ながら

Examples:

- お{風呂}^(ふろ)に{入}^(はい)ります

  入り is the 連用形 form of 入る.

- カラスが{飛}^(と)んでいるのが{見}^(み)えた

  飛ん is the 連用形 form of 飛ぶ, and 見え is the 連用形 form of 見る.

- {彼}^(かれ)に{会}^(あ)って{真相}^(しんそう)を{確}^(たし)かめる

  会っ is the 連用形 form of 会う.

連用形 verbs can also be used without a suffix. For example:

> {雨}^(あめ)が {降}^(ふ)り、{雷}^(ゆき)が {鳴}^(な)る (降り is the 連用形 form of 降る)

This usage is called {中止法}^(ちゅうしほう) (an "inflectional termination"
where the 連用形 verb functions as a conjunction between independent clauses).

Below, we are going to focus specifically on the 連用形 + て usage.

There are at least two cases to consider.

### 連用形 + て followed by 補助動詞

{補助動詞}^(ほじょどうし) (and {補助形容詞}^(ほじょけいようし)) are a special type of
_auxiliary verb_.[^1] They are effectively weakened or altered versions of a
standalone verb. They reduced or altered the original meaning of the verb, and
instead _modify_ whatever precedes it.

[^1]:
    {助動詞}^(じょどうし) are "auxiliary verbs". The character {補}^(ほ) means
    "supplemental". So {補助動詞}^(ほじょどうし) means "_supplemental_ auxiliary verbs".
    Yeah, the author really hates this term, too.

The following (non-exhaustive) list of words are 補助動詞:

- ある
- いる
- おく
- くる
- くれる
- しまう
- みせる
- みる
- もらう
- やる
- ゆく (いく)
- くださる ({敬語}^(けいご))
- ございます (敬語)
- あげる (敬語)
- さしあげる (敬語)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Admonition title="Note">
By convention, {補助動詞}^(ほじょどうし) are normally written in ひらがな rather than {漢字}^(かんじ).
</Admonition>

Since 補助動詞 are _auxiliary_ verbs (as opposed to standalone), we include them
on the same baseline as the _immediately preceding_ 形容詞 verb:

<Diagram filename="hayakuokitekudasai.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {早}^(はや)く{起}^(お)きてください
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">Please wake early</p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- ください is the imperative form of the verb {下}^(くだ)さる.

- Here, it is 補助動詞 appended to the verb 起きて, and not a standalone verb.

- The subject is the listener, with the zero-pronoun standing in as the literal
  subject.

- Syntactically, 起きてください acts as a single, standalone 用言.

Note that 連用形 verbs are called "continuative form" because they often imply a
sense of continuation (simultaneous or consecutive) rather than being purely
conjunctions like "and" or "but".

Because of this, Japanese sentences sometimes include an entire string of
て-connected verbs. By convention we only put the final 連用形 verb + 助動詞・助詞 + 補助動詞
on the baseline. The remainder are diagrammed as _modifiers_ (effectively acting
like adverbs) for clarity.

For example, here's something a parent might say to a child:

<Diagram filename="tabetehamigaite.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {食}^(た)べて{歯磨}^(はみが)いて{早}^(はや)く{寝}^(ね)てください
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">
    Please eat, brush your teeth, then quickly go to sleep
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- The "core" of the sentence is 寝てください.

- 寝てください is again a single, standalone 用言 (a 連用形動詞 + 補助動詞).

- The 連用形 て-suffixed verbs act like modifiers. In this case they
  indicate consecutive actions leading up to the final 用言 (寝てください). We
  diagram them exactly the same as other modifiers (hanging them below what they
  modify).

- These て-form verbs (食べて and 磨いて) **share the same subject as the final 用
  言**. They are normally diagrammed as simple modifiers rather than complete clauses
  with their own subjects.

  There _might_ be unusual circumstances where full clauses with separate
  subjects on the same baseline might be warranted. For example, when trying to
  explain the ambiguity in phrases like「もらってあげてくれませんか」.

- Each of the て modifiers hangs below the main baseline. In this case, the
  actions are clearly intended to be consecutive rather than simultaneous, but
  that might not always be the case. Regardless, that's a semantic
  interpretation. The structural diagram should always show these て modifiers
  hanging directly below the baseline rather than from one another.

### 連用形 + て followed by 動詞

<Diagram filename="kareniatte.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {彼}^(かれ)に{会}^(あ)って{真相}^(しんそう)を{確}^(たし)かめる
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">
    <u>I</u> will meet with him and ascertain the real-situation
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- The "core" clause is simply 「確かめる」 (just the verb "ascertain", using a
  [potential form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conjugation-groups/#godan-verbs-) conjugation)

- A 連用形 verb 「会って」that modifies the core predicate ("will meet and ...", using the [continuative
  form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/te-form/#form-for-and) verb)

- "I" is underlined since the subject isn't explicitly stated. It's
  usually safe to assume the speaker when the subject is omitted, but as
  indicated by the zero-pronoun in the diagram, the subject
  _could_ be "he", "she", "they", or even "it".

It's somewhat eye-opening to contrast this diagram with a "Reed-Kellog" diagram of the similar English
sentence "He will meet with him and I will ascertain the real situation":

<Diagram filename="hewillmeetIwillascertain.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    He will meet with him and I will ascertain the real situation
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- This example is a _compound_ sentence with two independent clauses.

- The word "and" is a conjunction connecting the two clauses.

- Each clause has an explicit subject.

Regardless, it's clear that our system for diagramming Japanese sentences is
_rapidly_ diverging from the Reed-Kellog system.

### 〜ば (conditional form)

The next example is a {川柳}^(せんりゅう), a sort of informal light-hearted, comedic
poem with the same 5&#8209;7&#8209;5 structure as haiku.

The author's interpretation of this poem's meaning is diagrammed below:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Diagram filename="shuminichibu.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {趣味}^(しゅみ){日舞}^(にちぶ)・{詳}^(くわ)しく{聞}^(き)けば・{盆踊}^(ぼんおど)り
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">
    If <u>you</u> ask about <u>my</u> traditional dance hobby in detail, it's bon-odori
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- Poems aren't necessarily complete or grammatical. This diagram shows one
  possible interpretation. It diagrams the author's understanding of the
  the poem's _meaining_ (if it were written as a complete sentence). Other
  interpretations are, of course, possible and equally valid.

  A direct transliteration of all three stanzas, without attempting to fill in
  missing grammatical structure or other details would just be something like:

  > Japanese-traditional-dance-hobby <br />
  > if-ask in-detail <br />
  > bon-odori

  We've chosen to "fill in the blanks" as shown in the translation above the
  diagram.

- [Bon odori](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_(festival)#Bon_Odori>) is a type
  of folk dance performed during "O-bon" seasonal festivals.
  [{日本舞踊}^(にほんぶよう)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%88%9E%E8%B8%8A)
  means "Japanese (traditional) dance", and {趣味}^(しゅみ) means "hobby".

  趣味日舞 is thus a compound word (a noun) meaning "Japanese-traditional-dance-hobby".

  This senryu pokes fun at someone putting on airs about their participation in
  an annual festival (that almost everyone participates in at some point).

- This is a compound sentence with dependent clauses: "If A then B" or here,
  「聞けば ... 盆踊りだ」.

  - The first (聞けば) uses a [conditional
    form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conditional-form-ba/)
    verb.

  - The second (盆踊りだ) has a subject that is logically/semantically dependent on
    the first clause (shown with a dotted line). The "it", represented by the zero
    pronoun, is logically the result of the asking.

- The second "clause" is just a single noun: 盆踊り ([a festival dance during the Obon
  holiday](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_(festival)#Bon_Odori>)). Both the
  subject and the final 助動詞 「だ」in that clause are implied, so they are shown
  in brackets in the diagram.

- The particle 「を」 is also shown in brackets because it isn't literally
  present in the original (likely due to morae-count constraints with the poetic
  form). That is most likely the intended structure (it's hard to imagine any
  other interpretation for the poem to make sense).

- "you" is underlined since the subject isn't explicitly specified.
  It's _probably_ the listener, but this implied subject is also a zero-pronoun:
  it _could_ be a third person ("he", "she", "they" or even "it" are conceivably
  possible.)

- "my" is also underlined since the original doesn't specify who's hobby it is.
  With no other context, it's reasonable to assume the speaker, but they could
  be referring to a third party (e.g. "her" hobby). Note that this isn't a
  missing subject, it's missing an entire modifier (私の or 彼女の 趣味日舞, for
  example).

- The subject of the top clause ("it") logically refers to the traditional dance
  hobby, so we've added a dotted line to indicate the fact.
