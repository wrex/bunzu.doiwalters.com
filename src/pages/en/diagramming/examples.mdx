better place to put them.

## The menagerie

### て form 連用形 (continuative)

<Diagram filename="kareniatte.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {彼}^(かれ)に{会}^(あ)って{真相}^(しんそう)を{確}^(たし)かめる
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">
    [@] will meet with him and ascertain the real-situation
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- This is a compound sentence with two clauses:

  - The main clause: 「真相を確かめる」 ("ascertain the real-situation", using a
    [potential form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conjugation-groups/#godan-verbs-) verb)

  - A subsidiary clause: 「彼に会って」("will meet him and ...", using a [continuative
    form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/te-form/#form-for-and) verb)

- The separate clauses _could_ have different explicit subjects, so they must be
  diagrammed on independent clause lines.

- 会って is the continuative form of 会う. It would often be translated as
  "will meet and ..." or "having met, will ...". Japanese and English use different
  grammatical constructs to represent sequential or simultaneous activities:

      - The Japanese original uses {連用形}^(れんようけい) (a continuative verb form, like
      <span style="word-break: keep-all;">〜て、〜ても、〜たり、〜ながら).</span>

      - The English "will meet and ..." structure is also a _compound_ form, but uses a conjunction
      ("and") to link two independent clauses. English doesn't really have an
      exact equivalent to continuative verb forms.

- Syntactically, both clauses have their own independent subjects. Logically
  (semantically), however, the subject of the 確かめる clause (the one doing the
  ascertaining) is the same subject as the one doing the meeting. The dotted line
  shows this logical implication.

This diagram attempts to mirror how it would like if we diagrammed an English
translation using the Reed-Kellog system. If we were to diagram the similar English
sentence "He will meet with him and I will ascertain the real situation" using Reed-Kellog
diagramming rules, it would look like this:

<Diagram filename="hewillmeetIwillascertain.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    He will meet with him and I will ascertain the real situation
  </p>
</Diagram>

(Note that this English sentence explicitly uses different subjects in the two
clauses. The Japanese example had the same logical subject, hence the dotted line.)

### 〜ば (conditional form)

The example below is a {川柳}^(せんりゅう), a sort of informal light-hearted, comedic
poem with the same 5&#8209;7&#8209;5 structure as haiku:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Diagram filename="shuminichibu.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {趣味}^(しゅみ){日舞}^(にちぶ)・{詳}^(くわ)しく{聞}^(き)けば・{盆踊}^(ぼんおど)り
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">
    If [@] asks [about] traditional-dance-hobby, [it's] bon-odori
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- Poems aren't necessarily complete or grammatical. This diagram shows one
  possible interpretation, but other interpretations are quite possible and
  equally valid.

  A direct transliteration of all three stanzas, without attempting to fill in
  missing grammatical structure would just be something like
  "Japanese-traditional-dance-hobby / if-ask in-detail / bon-odori".

  We've chosen to "fill in the blanks" by interpreting this as meaning:
  "If you ask about the traditional-dance-hobby, it's bon-odori".

- [Bon odori](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_(festival)#Bon_Odori>) is a type
  of folk dance performed during "O-bon" seasonal festivals.
  [{日本舞踊}^(にほんぶよう)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%88%9E%E8%B8%8A)
  means "Japanese (traditional) dance", and {趣味}^(しゅみ) means "hobby".

  趣味日舞 is thus a compound word (a noun) meaning "Japanese-traditional-dance-hobby".

  This senryu pokes fun at someone putting on airs about their participation in
  an annual festival (that almost everyone participates in at some point).

- This is also a compound sentence with independent clauses (like the potential
  form example above). In this case, a [conditional
  form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conditional-form-ba/) verb
  (聞けば) connects the two clauses rather in a continuative way (if-asked _then_
  ...).

- Because the two clauses are connected similar to the continuative-verb case,
  we diagram them similarly (with a dotted line connecting the two clauses).
