better place to put them.

## The menagerie

### て form 連用形 (continuative)

<Diagram filename="kareniatte.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {彼}^(かれ)に{会}^(あ)って{真相}^(しんそう)を{確}^(たし)かめる
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">
    I<sup>\*</sup> will meet with him and ascertain the real-situation
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- This is a compound sentence with two clauses:

  - The main clause: 「真相を確かめる」 ("ascertain the real-situation", using a
    [potential form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conjugation-groups/#godan-verbs-) verb)

  - A subsidiary clause: 「彼に会って」("will meet him and ...", using a [continuative
    form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/te-form/#form-for-and) verb)

- The separate clauses _could_ have different explicit subjects, so they must be
  diagrammed on independent clause lines.

- "I" is marked with an asterisk since the subject isn't explicitly stated. It's
  usually safe to assume the speaker when the subject is admitted, but as
  indicated by the zero-pronoun in the diagram, the subject
  _could_ be "he", "she", "they", or even "it".

- Syntactically, both clauses have their own independent subjects. Logically
  (semantically), however, the subject of the 確かめる clause (the one doing the
  ascertaining) is the same subject as the one doing the meeting. The dotted line
  shows this logical implication.

- 会って is the "continuative" form of 会う. It would often be translated as
  "will meet and ..." or "having met, will ...". Japanese and English use different
  grammatical constructs to represent sequential or simultaneous activities:

      - The Japanese original uses {連用形}^(れんようけい) (a continuative verb form, like
      <span style="word-break: keep-all;">〜て、〜ても、〜たり、〜ながら).</span>

      - The English "will meet and ..." structure is also a _compound_ form, but uses a conjunction
      ("and") to link two independent clauses. English doesn't really have an
      exact equivalent to continuative verb forms, but conjunctions come close.

This diagram attempts to mirror how it would like if we diagrammed an English
translation using the Reed-Kellog system. If we were to diagram the similar English
sentence "He will meet with him and I will ascertain the real situation" using Reed-Kellog
diagramming rules, it would look like this:

<Diagram filename="hewillmeetIwillascertain.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    He will meet with him and I will ascertain the real situation
  </p>
</Diagram>

(Note that this English sentence explicitly uses different subjects in the two
clauses. The Japanese example had the same logical subject, hence the dotted line.)

### 〜ば (conditional form)

The next example is a {川柳}^(せんりゅう), a sort of informal light-hearted, comedic
poem with the same 5&#8209;7&#8209;5 structure as haiku.

The author's interpretation of this poem's meaning is diagrammed below:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Diagram filename="shuminichibu.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {趣味}^(しゅみ){日舞}^(にちぶ)・{詳}^(くわ)しく{聞}^(き)けば・{盆踊}^(ぼんおど)り
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">
    If you<sup>\*</sup> ask about my<sup>\*</sup> traditional dance hobby in detail, it's bon-odori
  </p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- Poems aren't necessarily complete or grammatical. This diagram shows one
  possible translation, but other interpretations are at least possible and
  equally valid.

  A direct transliteration of all three stanzas, without attempting to fill in
  missing grammatical structure or other details would just be something like

  > Japanese-traditional-dance-hobby <br />
  > if-ask in-detail <br />
  > bon-odori

  We've chosen to "fill in the blanks" as shown in the translation above the
  diagram.

- [Bon odori](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_(festival)#Bon_Odori>) is a type
  of folk dance performed during "O-bon" seasonal festivals.
  [{日本舞踊}^(にほんぶよう)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%88%9E%E8%B8%8A)
  means "Japanese (traditional) dance", and {趣味}^(しゅみ) means "hobby".

  趣味日舞 is thus a compound word (a noun) meaning "Japanese-traditional-dance-hobby".

  This senryu pokes fun at someone putting on airs about their participation in
  an annual festival (that almost everyone participates in at some point).

- This is also a compound sentence with independent clauses (like the potential
  form example above). In this case, a [conditional
  form](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conditional-form-ba/) verb
  (聞けば) connects the two clauses rather in a continuative way (if-asked _then_
  ...). We still use a dotted line to show the connection.

- One "clause" is just a single noun: 盆踊り ([a festival dance during the Obon
  holiday](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_(festival)#Bon_Odori>)). Both the
  subject and the final 助動詞 「だ」in that clause are implied, so they are shown
  in brackets in the diagram.

- The particle 「を」 is also shown in brackets because it isn't literally
  present in the original (likely due to morae-count constraints with the poetic
  form), but for the poem to make any sense, that must be the intended structure.

- "you" is marked with an asterisk since the subject isn't explicitly specified.
  It's _probably_ the listener, but this implied subject is also a zero-pronoun:
  it _could_ be a third person ("he", "she", "they" or even "it" are conceivably
  possible.)

- "my" is also marked with an asterisk since the original doesn't specify who will
  receive the question. With no other context, it's reasonable to assume the
  speaker, but they could be referring to a third party ("she" or "he").

- The subject of the top clause ("it") logically refers to the traditional dance
  hobby, so we've added a dotted line to indicate the fact.
