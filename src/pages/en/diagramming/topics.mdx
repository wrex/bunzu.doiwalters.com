To an English-speaking layman, the words "topic" and "subject" seem pretty much
identical. They both can mean "what we're currently discussing".

Grammarians, though, make a distinction:

- The grammatical _subject_ refers to the "doer" in a clause. The Japanese word
  for "subject" is {主語}^(しゅご). It's the "master" that is doing whatever is
  indicated by the predicate. (The predicate specifies whether the "master" is
  performing an action or just "existing" in some state.)

- The word _topic_ ({題目}^(だいもく)) is reserved for "what we're currently discussing". It
  simply provides overall context. A _topic_ might be explicit (actually
  mentioned within a sentence) or implicit (from prior sentences or based on
  where a conversation is occurring).

  A sentence might mean different things in different contexts. The _topic_
  clarifies what specific meaning was intended.

English doesn't use _explicit_ topics very often. When we do, it's usually with
a construct like:

> As for ◯, ...

or

> Regarding ◯, ...

The _topic_ is whatever was in the circle.

Japanese, however, uses explicit topics
(<ruby>題目<rp>(</rp><rt>だいもく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) _all the time._ This leads to
much confusion for English-speaking language learners, since even extremely
simple and incredibly common sentences contain explicit _topics_ but only
implicit _subjects_.

## I am an American

Take this extremely simple, common sentence:

> {私}^(わたし)はアメリカ{人}^(じん)です

Most people would translate that into English as "I am an American".

_Semantically_, that would be absolutely correct. That's what the sentence
_means_.

Structurally, though, that's not what the sentence actually _says_!

We use a more literal _transliteration_ (vs. translation) in the diagram below:

<Diagram filename="watashihaamerikajindesu.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {私}^(わたし)はアメリカ{人}^(じん)です
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">Me, [I] am-American-person</p>
</Diagram>

The character 私 in this sentence is the 題目 (topic) "me" and _not_ the
grammatical subject (that's why it goes on a dotted line, and not on the "core"
clause baseline). A _topic_ is never the "doer" in a sentence, it just provides
context. The subject does the doing or being, not the topic.

Think of it this way: the _topic_ is "me", but the implied _logical_ subject is
"I". The literal, syntactic subject isn't explicitly provided (so we imagine the
zero pronoun standing in for it).

<Admonition title="Important">

The particle は **never**, repeat _never,_ identifies the grammatical subject!

It quite often introduces a _topic_ that _implies_ a subject, but it never
indicates the subject itself.

An explicit subject for a clause will always be identified by the particle が,
never by は.

</Admonition>

Notes:

- For such a simple sentence, there's more going on here than you might think:

  - The _topic_ is "me" (not "I"). Topics are indicated by the particle は. We
    diagram topics with dotted lines connecting to the clauses they affect
    (implying context, not action/state).

  - The _subject_ ([主語](/en/grammar/7-construction#%E4%B8%BB%E8%AA%9E-subjects)) is the zero
    pronoun, @, standing in for "I".

  - The _predicate_ ([述語](/en/grammar/7-construction#%E8%BF%B0%E8%AA%9E-predicates)) is
    アメリカ人です.

    - アメリカ人 is a 名詞 (noun) meaning American-person. In English,
      "American" can also be a noun meaning the same thing, but we use
      "American-person" to make it explicit that it's a noun and not the
      adjective "American".

    - です is a 助動詞 (auxiliary verb) acting as a _copula._ It's the polite form of だ.

      - 助動詞 never work on their own, they are _auxiliary_ words that must always
        attach to other words.

      - A copula _couples_ the preceding noun to the subject (just like the
        English words "is" or "am"). In this case, it says that the
        subject (@) _is_ an American person.

    - The combination of 名詞＋助動詞 forms a
      [用言](/en/grammar/grammar-intro#%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%80-predicate-words). It's correct to
      think of アメリカ人です as one grammatical unit, an "is-verb".

- The "core" clause of the sentence is just アメリカ人です
  ("is-American-person"). The topic is _not_ part of the core clause.

- If we were to read the transliteration aloud, it would be: "me,
  am-American-Person". As always, we skip over the stuff in brackets.

  There really is a logical subject in this sentence, even though it's merely
  implied. If we changed it to「私は彼がアメリカ人です」 ("As for me, he is an American person"),
  it would _sound_ weirdly verbose, but it is grammatically correct and has the
  _identical_ semantic meaning.

Exposing all this hidden complexity for such a simple sentence probably seems
unnecessary and possibly counter-productive, especially for such a simple
sentence where the topic and _logical_ subject refer to the same thing. But this
is exactly how this sentence actually _works._

Exposing this complexity in a diagram this way pays dividends once we start
analyzing more complex sentences.

## Topics and subjects can differ

In 私はアメリカ人です, the topic and the subject were the same human being (私).
That won't always be the case.

Take, for example, the English sentence "Every Sunday, my father makes sushi".
Here, the topic is "Sunday" but the subject of the primary clause is "my
father".

In Japanese:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Diagram filename="otousannosushi.svg">
  <p slot="original">
    {毎週日曜日}^(まいしゅうにちようび)はお{父}^(とう)さんが{寿司}^(すし)を{作}^(つく)る
  </p>
  <p slot="translation">Every-week-Sunday, father makes sushi</p>
</Diagram>

Notes:

- The topic is the long, compound word 毎週日曜日. This is a
  single compound 名詞 (noun) meaning "every Sunday" in English.

  The first two characters mean "every week". The final three characters are
  themselves a 名詞 meaning "Sunday". All together it expresses the semantic
  concept "every-week-Sunday" or "every Sunday".

  When kanji are just jammed together like this, where each part sequentially
  qualifies the next without any particles in between, think of
  them as single compound nouns.

  If the sentence had started 毎週**の**日曜日は〜, we would have shown 毎週の as a modifier hanging below the
  topic of 日曜日. Since there is no intervening particle, we've diagrammed
  it as a compound-noun instead.

- The core clause is お父さんが作る ("father makes"). The subject is お父さん (father) and the
  predicate is 作る (make).

- There is an explicit object in this example, 寿司, introduced with the
  particle を, so we hang it below the predicate. "Father makes sushi".
