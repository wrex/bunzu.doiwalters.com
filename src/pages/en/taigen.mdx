## Standalone, non-用言 words

There are five types of words that _aren't_ primarily about action or state.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (nouns)

These are words that can become _subjects_ or objects (introduced with the
particle を). Sub-types include pronouns, numbers, and counters.

名詞 means a word _type_, a part of speech. 体言 means the category of
subject or object words themselves. The two terms are effectively equivalent:
all 体言 are 名詞 (in English: all subject words are nouns).

Examples:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>新湯<rp>(</rp><rt>あらゆ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (a freshly drawn bath)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>森林<rp>(</rp><rt>もりばやし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (a wooded forest)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>副詞<rp>(</rp><rt>ふくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (adverbs)

These words modify or qualify 用言 (predicate words).

Note that despite calling these ad-_verbs_, they also modify 形容詞
and 形容動詞. Yet another reason for considering the latter as "is-verbs"
rather than "adjectives"!

Examples:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>再<rp>(</rp><rt>ふたた</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>び</strong>帰る, (to return
_again_)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong>とても</strong><ruby>面白<rp>(</rp><rt>おもしろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (_awfully_
interesting)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong>すこし</strong>静かだ (_slightly_ quiet)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>連体詞<rp>(</rp><rt>れんたいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (definite articles)

These modify 体言. They further qualify the meaning of a person or object to a _particular_ person or
thing that the audience already knows.

Examples:

- **この**猫 (_this_ cat)

- **あらゆる**方向 (_every_ direction)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>接続詞<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (conjunctives)

These words _connect_ two clauses or even different sentences together.

Examples:

- 食べない。**また**、たべたくはない！ (I won't eat it. _Further_, I've no
  desire to eat that!)

- おかしい、**しかし**きれいだ (It's strange, _however_ it's pretty)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>感動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>かんどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (interjections)

These are basically "uhm" words. Interjections or exclamatory words that don't
have much grammatical function.

Examples:

- さあ (used like "c'mon", "all right", or "oh" in English)

- はい (acknowledging you've heard someone -- this doesn't necessarily mean "yes"!)

## Auxiliary word-suffixes

This category is for words-suffixes, not standalone words. These should be
thought of as auxiliary or attached word _parts_ not words in themselves.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>助動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (auxiliary verbs)

Japanese 用言 have many different _inflections_. Just as we'd add other words in
English to connote different usages of a base verb ("eat" vs. "have eaten" vs.
"will eat"), Japanese adds 感動詞 to the ends of verbs to do the inflecting.

Note that 助動詞 can inflect _all_ 用言. This includes 形容詞 and 形容動詞,
not just 動詞. The specific methods/rules vary depending on what's being
modified, but 助動詞 aren't limited to suffixes that only affect 動詞 specifically.

Examples:

- 〜られる a suffix that makes a 用言 _passive_.

  - 食べ・る (to eat)

  - 食べ・られる (to be eaten)

- 〜ない a suffix that negeates the meaning of a 用言.

  - 食べ・ない (won't eat or doesn't eat)

  - 美味し・くない (not delicious)

  - 便利・じゃない (not convenient)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>助詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (particles)

Examples:

- 〜は (usually used to indicate a topic)

- 〜へ (usually used to indicate a destination or direction)
