## What's a Sentence Diagram?

Americans of a certain age might remember diagramming sentences while learning
English grammar in primary school.

The author was one of those annoying nerdy kids who loved them! He wondered if
it wouldn't be possible to create something similar for Japanese sentences.

_Sentence diagrams_ display the _structure_ of sentences to language
learners, without resorting to arcane grammatical jargon. They _visually_
display the internal structure of a sentence, breaking them into simple pieces
that show how a sentence _works_. They show the _core_ of the sentence, as
well as what parts modify or further describe what other parts (they _don't_
explain precisely what a sentence _means_ however).

_Anyone_ can view a sentence diagram and immediately understand the basic
information presented, even if they don't know a noun from a verb.

Here's an example diagram for an English sentence (using English rules that
won't be explained further):

![Sample Diagram](/images/english-diagram.png)

The original sentence is shown at the top: "Japanese people eat meals at home
with pointy sticks".

The large horizontal line shows that the fundamental "core" of that sentence is
"People eat meals".

The _subject_, _verb_, and _object_ in that core sentence are indicated by the
vertical lines that separate them, but _you don't need to know those words_ to
understand the diagram!

The diagram clearly shows that the "action" part of the sentence ("eat") is
modified by a bunch of other words. They eat "at home" and "with sticks". The
word "pointy" modifies or further describes the word "sticks".

## Syntax, not semantics

Note that sentence diagrams make no attempt to explain what a sentence _means_.
They only display how the various parts go together _structurally_. The linguistic/grammatical
jargon for this distinction is "semantics" (what it means) vs. "syntax" (the
structure).

Sentence diagrams _only_ show syntax. On their own, **they cannot explain subtle
differences in nuance or meaning**!

If the English sentence above was rewritten as:

> At home, Japanese people eat their meals with pointy sticks

the diagram would be _identical!_

The diagram for this reordered sentence would be absolutely identical
because the sentence _structure_, what modifies what, remains the same. But the
reordering imparts a different _nuance_: This new version emphasizes "_at home_"
more than "Japanese people" (possibly implying that they use their hands or
knives and forks elsewhere &mdash; how rude!).

That's a semantic difference, not a syntactic difference. It isn't represented
_at all_ in the diagram.

## Why diagram?

There are two primary reasons to diagram:

1. **Viewing** provides a vehicle for further discussion: for _teaching_. A
   teacher might, for example, want to contrast two different ways to express
   something (with different sentences/diagrams). Alternately, they might just want to
   show correct and incorrect ways to parse a given sentence.

2. **Creating** diagrams provides a tool for students to decipher potentially complex
   sentences. Creating sentence diagrams is an excellent way for beginners to
   reason about a sentence and better understand how the grammar _works_.

## 文章図式 <small>(Japanese sentence diagrams)</small>

This site is for English-speakers trying to learn _Japanese_. It describes a
system to create _Japanese_ sentence diagrams, or 文章図式. The author hopes that
Japanese sentence diagrams will help other beginners to better understand the
language.

The Japanese word for "sentence" is <ruby>文章<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんしょう
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (bunshou, literally "writing section"). One word for
diagram is <ruby>図式 <rp>(</rp><rt>ずしき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (zushiki, literally
"diagram method"). One way to say "sentence diagram" in Japanese is thus 文章図式
(bunshouzushiki), but that's quite a lot to type in Roman characters, so this
site omits the "shou" and and the "shiki" and just calls them "bunzu" (文図) for
short.

## Minimal jargon, but Japanese jargon

The author has done his best to avoid technical jargon whenever possible, but it's impossible to
describe how to _create_ these diagrams without resorting to grammatical terminology at
many points.

Whenever possible, this site uses _Japanese_ grammatical terms (with translations)
rather than the English terms alone. For example,

> <ruby>猫<rp>(</rp><rt>ねこ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (neko) is a <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし
> </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (meishi or "noun" meaning "cat").

The reason is that there are often subtle differences between the Japanese and
English concepts. Ultimately the grammar terms are just names for concepts.
Since the Japanese concepts are intended, it makes sense to use the Japanese
terms rather than force-fitting the English terms.

The word "noun" means pretty much exactly the same thing as 名詞 (a "named part of
speech") but this _won't_ always be the case. "Adjectives", for example are a
whole 'nother ball of wax.

## Some Japanese required

This site is aimed at Japanese learners.

While it's for beginners, it does assume some basic knowledge about the
language.

In particular, some familiarity with the writing systems is mandatory. You
should be able to [read
hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana-book-pdf/) and
[katana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana-book-pdf/) (the phonetic
writing systems). The linked
resources from Tofugu are excellent, and should suffice for much of the content
here.

It's _hard_ to make sense of Japanese sentences using hiragana and katakana
alone, however (not to mention space-consuming). So most of the example
sentences use at least some kanji (Chinese pictographic characters).

Whenever possible, the site uses simple kanji with English translations as
well.

Nevertheless, you must have at least a basic familiarity with kanji. The author
recommends getting through at least the first three (free!) levels on
[https://wanikani.com](Wanikani) (or something equivalent) before attempting to
use this site.

Note that the diagrams themselves don't use furigana (small hiragana/katakana
characters above the kanji). Unfortunately, it's painful to create them easily
in the [software we used to create the diagrams](https://figma.com).

It _is_ relatively straightforward to create furigana in `HTML` pages, however, so
these web pages use furigana everywhere _except_ in the diagrams themselves (as
well as providing English translations as much as possible).

Romaji (phonetic roman characters for Japanese words) will _not_ be used on the
remainder of this site.
