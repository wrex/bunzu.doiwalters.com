Japanese grammar is a very deep and difficult subject. What we cover here is
only the tip of the iceberg (it's just the high-level stuff necessary to
understand sentence diagrams).

## Grammar resources

For a more thorough introduction to Japanese grammar, the author highly recommends:

- [The Tofugu grammar hub](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/)

- [Cure Dolly's videos and
  book](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ)

  Warning: The book may be easier more comfortable for most people. The animated
  "android" and creepy voice can be a bit hard to take at first, but the content
  is well worth it. Much of this site reflects ideas from these videos. One
  strong recommendation: turn on subtitles and watch at 1.25X speed (with or
  without audio).

  Sadly, the author of these wonderful videos is no longer with us. I'm unsure
  of her background, but based on her slightly odd diction in _both_ languages, I
  suspect she was a native Japanese speaker who moved to an English speaking
  country as a child, and spent the majority of her life in the west.

- Jay Rubin's book _Making sense of Japanese_ is an outstanding resource. It
  does exactly what it promises, and many of the ideas underly both the Cure
  Dolly videos and this site. It's not structured as a textbook, but rather as
  more conversational prose. It introduces some of the most important aspects
  of the language (things that English-speakers tend to misunderstand).

## Units of composition

Japanese schoolteachers would teach these basic units or divisions of Japanese
writing, from largest to smallest:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>文章<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんしょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> Means writing in general (an article, composition, essay, or, an individual _sentence_.)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>段落<rp>(</rp><rt>だんらく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> A paragraph. Literally, "falling rows" of text.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>文<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> A sentence (that can be delimited with a period.)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> An individual clause or phrase within a sentence.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>単語<rp>(</rp><rt>たんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> An individual word.

We are only concerned with 文, 文節, and 単語 (sentences, clauses/phrases, and
words). In particular, identifying 文節 is the most critical part of diagramming.

## Parts of speech

{/* prettier-ignore */}
If 文章 are the "molecules" of Japanese, then <strong><ruby>品詞<rp>(</rp><rt>ひんし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (parts of speech) are the atoms.

That's not a perfect analogy, though. The character 詞 means "a part of speech."
It's used to indicate a grammatical _type_ or _function,_ and doesn't refer to
individual words themselves. The characters 言 or 語 usually usually refer to
individual words/speech or groups of words, while 詞 indicates parts-of-speech specifically.

Most of us are familiar with the _English_ parts-of-speech called _nouns_ and _verbs._
Unsurprisingly, Japanese has both of these as well, but the Japanese names are:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> "noun" (literally, "named part of speech")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> "verb" (literally,
  "movement/change part of speech")

Including these, Japanese has ten total parts of speech, broken into three major categories.

<Admonition title="Note">
  Many Japanese grammar resources only refer to **八**品詞, or _eight_ parts of
  speech. The diagram above also includes two additional types for
  auxiliary/partial words.
</Admonition>

The ten parts of speech are broken into three major categories as shown in the
diagram below:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1.  <strong><ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> are
    the most important category. Grammarians call these
    "inflectable" or "declinable" words that are used in the predicate. Honestly, the Japanese
    characters are easier to understand: 用言 means "use words" or "utilization
    words". They _do_ things.

2.  **Non-inflectable words**, or freestanding words that _aren't_ 用言.

3.  **Auxiliary or attached words-suffixes**

We will describe each of these categories in turn.

### The parts-of-speech taxonomy

</Figure>

### 用言: predicate words

Japanese has _three_ parts of speech in the 用言 category:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (verbs)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong>
      (so-called "い-adjectives", or just "adjectives")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> 
      (so-called "な-adjectives", or "nominalizing adjectives")

Dictionaries call 用言 called "inflectable" or "declinable" words. Non-grammarians
like the author don't understand jargon like "inflectable" or "declinable".

It's easier to understand what 用言 actually _do_.

These three word-types all _function_ like verbs (though technically, only 動詞
are _actually_ verbs). They are the part of a predicate that explain _what's happening_.

English tends to focus on the _who_ and _what_ within a sentence, while
Japanese tends to focus on the _action_ or _state._

English is often described as an "SVO" grammar (subject, verb, object in that
order). For example, the sentence: "I eat it" contains the subject "I", then the
verb "eat", and finally the object "it". We tend to focus on the first word of
that sentence: "I".

Japanese is often described as "SOV" because the verb comes at the end. They
tend to focus on the last word of a sentence, the verb.

Japanse is perhaps better considered an "SV" language, or even just a "V" language! In
Japanese, the exact same thought ("I eat it") might be expressed as:

> 「食べる」

This is still a complete sentence, even though it's only a single word!

The subject "I" and object "it" are _implied._ Japanese grammar rules allow
them to be omitted since they aren't necessary for understanding.

Imagine offering food to a hungry Tarzan. If he replied with an enthusiastic
"Eat!" (or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">「食べる！」</span> in Japanese), would you have any difficulty understanding that he will eat the
food you were offering?

English grammar explicitly requires words that, strictly speaking, aren't
necessary.

The words "I" and "it" would be _unnecessary_ for comprehension. The verb
"eat" communicates all we need to know, but English grammar rules pretty
much _mandate_ that we provide the unnecessary words (else we sound like
Tarzan).

Japanese doesn't work that way! (Which makes one wonder how Tarzan-speech is
represented in Japanese manga.)

Japanese is a _denser_ language. It's more efficient because it allows you to
omit unneccesary pronouns like "I" and "it".

<Admonition title="Note">
  _用言 are the most important parts of a Japanese sentence._ Since they come at
  the _end_ of sentences, it's not much of an overstatement to say that Japanese
  is sort of read from the end of a sentence _backwards_.
</Admonition>

### 体言 and other "freestanding" types

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>体言<rp>(</rp><rt>たいげん </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> literally means "subject/body" words.

体言 are "substantive" words that can become the 主語 (subject) of a sentence.

体言 are always 名詞 (nouns) and are the most important word types in this category.

In addition, however, this category also includes four more word types that
_can't_ become a subject. The other types break down into two more
categories:

1.  Modifiers/qualifiers and conjoiners

    a. 用言 modifers/qualifiers: <strong><ruby>副詞<rp>(</rp><rt>ふくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (adverbs)

    b. 体言 modifiers/qualifiers: <strong><ruby>連体詞<rp>(</rp><rt>れんたいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> ("definite articles")

    c. Conjoiners: <strong><ruby>接続詞<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> ("conjunctives")

2.  Words that _don't_ modify/qualify or conjoin: <strong><ruby>感動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>かんどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (interjections).

### Helper word-suffixes

These aren't standalone words, but things that attach as suffixes to other
words.

There are two types:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1. <strong><ruby>助動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (auxiliary verbs)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
2. <strong><ruby>助詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (particles)

## Summary

The most important parts-of-speech categories are 用言 and 体言:

- **体言** literally means "object words" or "body words". They are _always_ 名詞 or
  things that have been "nominalized" to act like nouns.

- **用言** literally means "use words". They includes _three_ different parts of
  speech, not only 動詞 (verbs), but 形容詞 and 形容動詞 as well.

<Admonition title="Important">
**体言** form the <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(subject) of a sentence. They are the "doers".

**用言** form the <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(predicate). They inform "what is being done".

</Admonition>

All of these parts of speech will be explained in more detail on subsequent
pages.
