Finally we can get to actually creating some diagrams!

Step one couldn't be any easier:

<Admonition title="Step 1: Write down the original sentence">

Simply write the original sentence you plan to diagram at the top of the page.

Optionally, you can also write an English _transliteration_ for the sentence
immediately below the original. (More on this later.)

</Admonition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
## The core <ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (clause)

Every sentence (in any language) has at least one clause (compound sentences might have multiple).

Every 文節 (clause) has a 主語 (subject) and a 述語 (predicate). There can be
many words (including complete clauses/phrases) that modify each of these, but
at the core of the sentence there will always be a 体言 acting as the subject,
and a 用言 acting as the predicate.

<Admonition title="Step 2: Core clause Baseline & separator">

First draw a horizontal line. This will act as a baseline for the subject and
predicate to rest on.

Then draw a vertical line to separate the subject from the predicate. This line
should extend above and below the baseline, and should be positioned somewhere
central.

Then write the _core_ 主語 to the left of the separator, and the core 述語
to the right.

</Admonition>

Let's start with an extremely simple example:

> 私が食べた ("I ate")

There's obviously only one clause, and single words for both parts of that clause:

- The 主語 is the single word 私 (identified by the particle が). "I" am doing the action.

- The 述語 is the single verb 食べた (the past tense of 食べる). The action was "eating".

Here is how we'd diagram that sentence:

<Figure caption="私が食べた" resetCounter>
  ![diagram for 'I ate'](/images/ex1-I-ate.png)
</Figure>

There are a few things to notice:

- If you ignore any lines or symbols and simply _read_ what's on the baseline, you get the
  core clause 「私が食べた」. (This happens to be the entire sentence in this
  example, but that won't usually be the case.)

- The particle が is explicitly included with the 主語 since it's literally
  present in the original sentence (が identifies subjects).

- This sentence doesn't use the plain or dictionary form of the 動詞　食べる, it
  uses an inflection (食べた). We use a dot to separate the stem of the verb
  from any 助動詞 (auxiliary verbs). (This example happens to use an 一段動詞.)

- If the sentence was 私が食べる ("I eat"), we _wouldn't_ use a dot. The
  predicate would just be 食べる (since that's what will be found in the dictionary).

### Other 用言 types

The 述語 (predicate) won't always be a 動詞 (verb). It could also be 形容詞 or
形容動詞. We might, for example have the sentences:

- 私が眠い (translation: "I am sleepy")

- 私が静かだ (translation: "I am quiet")

The structure is identical (original sentences elided to save space):

<Figure caption="Other 用言">
  ![other 用言 diagrams](/images/ex2-other-yougen.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- Since 形容詞 appear in the dictionary _with_ the い appended, we don't use a
  dot (the い isn't a particle).

- Since 形容動詞 _don't_ include the final だ in the dictionary, we use a dot
  between the 形容動詞 and the 助動詞 (auxiliary verb) だ.

- Note in particular that だ in that last example is a 助動詞, an _auxiliary_ verb.
  It turns 静か into a 用言, but neither part is a verb, nor does either part function
  alone. _Both_ parts _together_ become a 用言 and form the predicate.

### Polite forms

So far we've used plain forms of the verbs. Using polite forms doesn't change much:

<Figure caption="Polite forms">
  ![diagrams for polite forms](/images/ex3-polite-forms.png)
</Figure>

Again we've left out the original sentences since they are obvious, and again we
separate the dictionary forms with a dot. These are polite forms of 用言, but
nothing has changed structurally.

## Implied parts

Amazingly, Japanese sentences can leave out _either_ the subject or the
predicate and they still make sense.

### Implied subjects

If all that's given is 用言, the subject is implied. As discussed in the grammar
section, [it's helpful to think of the zero pronoun filling in when the subject
is omitted](http://localhost:3000/en/bunsetsu#the-zero-pronoun).

Say, for example, the sentence was simply 「食べた」(a verb meaning "ate"). It isn't
explicit from the sentence who or what did the eating, so we use the zero
pronoun to stand in for "he" or "she" or "it":

<Figure caption="The zero pronoun">
  ![diagram with the zero pronoun](/images/ex4-zero-pronoun.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- We use "@" to represent the zero pronoun. We use brackets to show that neither
  the @ nor が are literally present in the original sentence.

- The core clause along the baseline is _read_ 「食べた」 -- the stuff in brackets is ignored.

  [Unless we are talking about _the diagram_ rather than the original sentence.
  In that case, it's helpful to say「『まるが』食べた」 with "air quotes" around
  the first bit.]

- This sentence does _not_ mean "I ate", nor does it mean "she ate", nor "it
  ate". Without additional context we simply don't know who or what's
  doing the eating, so we use &ldquo;@&rdquo; to fill in.

### Implying _predicates_

As also discussed
[previously](http://localhost:3000/en/bunsetsu#missing-%E8%BF%B0%E8%AA%9E), it's
possible to create single-word sentences out of 体言 (basically nouns) or the
"adjectives".

Diagramming the examples from that section:

<Figure caption="Implied predicates">
  ![Implied predicates](/images/ex5-cow-quiet-cold.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- Despite all the extra stuff in brackets that make things that are only
  _implied_ visible, these diagrams are simply display three _one-word_ sentences:

  - 「牛」(transliterated: "@ is-cow")

  - 「静か」(transliterated: "@ is-quiet")

  - 「寒い」 (transliterated: "@ is-cold")

- The single word provided must be interpreted as 用言 -- they form the
  _predicate_, not the subject.

- The zero object is the implied subject in all three sentences. There is no way to know
  from the original sentences alone if the subjects are "I", "he", "she", or
  "it". The semantic meaning comes from context.

- We _don't_ add an implied だ with 形容詞. The word 寒い is _already_ 用言. It
  doesn't need the だ　助動詞 to turn it into one.

## Modifiers

Japanese has a wonderful system of [助詞 or
particles](http://localhost:3000/en/taigen#%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%98%E3%82%87%E3%81%97-particles)
that explicitly inform us of what different parts of a sentence are doing. They
can tell us if something is specifying a location, a starting point, an ending
point, a means of doing something, etc.

These modifiers don't actually change the meaning of the core clause, however.
They just provide more, finer-grained information.

<Admonition title="Step 3. Add any modifiers">
  Most sentences will be more complex than just a simple 主語 and a simple 述語.

Most will have various modifiers informing us of other things going on, or
different qualifiers for the subject and predicate.

Draw each modifier on a "hanger" hanging below the thing it's modifying. Place
them from left to right in the same order they appear in the original
sentence.

If there are any explicit particles identifying a modifier, write them on the
stem of the "hanger".

</Admonition>

### Grammatical objects

One particularly interesting modifier is identified by the particle を. It
introduces a grammatical _object_, something the 述語 is acting on or with.

None of the example sentences so far have involved an object, so let's add an
object to our "I ate" example. Let's diagram "I ate _sushi_".

<Figure caption="Objects">![Objects](/images/ex6-objects.png)</Figure>

Notes:

- The original sentence in it's entirety is 「寿司を食べた」.

- The core clause is just 「食べた」.

- An English translation of that core clause is impossible without more context.
  We don't know who or what ate the sushi. We don't know whether to use a
  subject of "I", "he", "she", or "it". So we use the magic zero pronoun @
  instead.

- The object affectively modifies or _qualifies_ the 述語. It tells us _what_
  was eaten. English sentence diagrams have a special notation for objects, but
  Japanese sentence diagrams just dangle them below whatever they are
  modifying/qualifying.
- Unlike the stuff on the horizontal line (the core of a clause) we don't
  include the particle with the word 寿司. Instead, we write the particle on the
  stem of the "hangar". This informs us what type of modifying/qualifying is
  going on.

### Other modifiers

Modifiers can affect the subject as well as the predicate. They can even modify
other modifiers.

Let's take a more complex example:

<Figure caption="Several modifiers">
  ![Several modifiers](/images/ex7-white-dog-eating.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- Modifiers hang below the main clause baseline in the order they appear in the
  original sentence. The sentence starts with 白い so it attaches to the left of the
  subject.

- 形容詞 can also act as modifiers for 体言 as well as appearing in the 述語, but they
  don't need a particle. They always confer a sense of nature or state. So the
  stem of the first modifier remains bare.

- All the other modifiers have explicit particles indicating what information
  they impart. The _location_ is "inside" (indicated by で). The eating is
  happening "quietly" (indicated by に).

- Multiple modifiers affecting the same thing are placed next to each other (中
  で and 静かに both affect the predicate, so they are next to each other on the
  same row).

- Modifiers can also "stack" (modifiers can modify other modifiers). The noun 家
  (いえ, meaning house) is modifying "inside". The particle の indicates which
  particular inside we are talking about.

- Each row of modifiers adds a little more information to the core clause, but
  still forms complete, grammatical sentences:

  - The core clause reads 「犬が食べている」

  - With the next row of modifiers, it reads: 「白い犬が中で静かに食べている」

  - With the final row, we get back to the original sentence: 「白い犬が家の中で静かに食べている」
