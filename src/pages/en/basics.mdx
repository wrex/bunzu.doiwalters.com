Finally we can get to actually creating some diagrams!

Step one couldn't be any easier:

<Admonition title="Step 1: Write down the original sentence">

Simply write the original sentence you plan to diagram at the top of the page.

Optionally, you can also write an English _transliteration_ for the sentence
immediately below the original. (More on this later.)

</Admonition>

## The core <ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (clause)

Every sentence (in any language) has at least one clause (compound sentences might have multiple).

Every 文節 (clause) has a 主語 (subject) and a 述語 (predicate). There can be
many words (including complete clauses/phrases) that modify each of these, but
at the core of the sentence there will always be a 体言 acting as the subject,
and a 用言 acting as the predicate.

<Admonition title="Step 2: Core clause Baseline & separator">

First draw a horizontal line. This will act as a baseline for the subject and
predicate to rest on.

Then draw a vertical line to separate the subject from the predicate. This line
should extend above and below the baseline, and should be positioned somewhere
central.

Finally write in the _core_ 主語 to the left of the separator, and the core 述語
to the right.

### Ex 1: 私が食べた

Let's start with an extremely simple example:

> 私が食べた ("I ate")

There's obviously only one clause, and single words for both parts of that clause:

- The 主語 is the single word 私 (identified by the particle が). "I" am doing the action.

- The 述語 is the single verb 食べた (the past tense of 食べる). The action was "eating".

Here is how we'd diagram that sentence:

![Example 1: I ate](/images/ex1-I-ate.png)

There are a few things to notice:

- If you ignore any lines or symbols and simply _read_ what's on the baseline, you get the
  core clause 「私が食べた」. (This happens to be the entire sentence in this
  example, but that won't usually be the case.)

- The particle が is explicitly included with the 主語 since it's literally
  present in the original sentence (が identifies subjects).

- This sentence doesn't use the plain or dictionary form of the 動詞　食べる, it
  uses an inflection (食べた). We use a dot to separate the stem of the verb
  from any 助動詞 (auxiliary verbs). (This example happens to use an 一段動詞.)

- If the sentence was 私が食べる ("I eat"), we _wouldn't_ use a dot. The
  predicate would just be 食べる (since that's what will be found in the dictionary).

### Other 用言 types

The 述語 (predicate) won't always be a 動詞 (verb). It could also be 形容詞 or
形容動詞. We might, for example have the sentences:

- 私が眠い (translation: "I am sleepy")

- 私が静かだ (translation: "I am quiet")

The structure is identical (original sentences elided to save space):

![Example 2: Other 用言](/images/ex2-other-yougen.png)

Notes:

- Since 形容詞 appear in the dictionary _with_ the い appended, we don't use a
  dot (the い isn't a particle).

- Since 形容動詞 _don't_ include the final だ in the dictionary, we use a dot
  between the 形容動詞 and the 助動詞 (auxiliary verb) だ.

- Note in particular that だ in that last example is a 助動詞, an _auxiliary_ verb.
  It turns 静か into a 用言, but neither part is a verb, nor does either part function
  alone. _Both_ parts _together_ become a 用言 and form the predicate.

### Polite forms

So far we've used plain forms of the verbs. Using polite forms doesn't change much:

![Example 3: Polite forms](/images/ex3-polite-forms.png)

Again we've left out the original sentences since they are obvious, and again we
separate the dictionary forms with a dot. These are polite forms of 用言, but
nothing has changed structurally.

## Implied parts

Amazingly, Japanese sentences can leave out _either_ the subject or the
predicate and they still make sense.

### Leaving out the subject

If all that's given is 用言, the subject is implied. As discussed in the grammar
section, [it's helpful to think of the zero pronoun filling in when the subject
is omitted](http://localhost:3000/en/bunsetsu#the-zero-pronoun).

Say, for example, the sentence was simply 「食べた」. It isn't explicit from the
sentence who or what did the eating, so we use the zero pronoun to stand in for
"he" or "she" or "it":

![Example 4: The zero pronoun](/images/ex4-zero-pronoun.png)

Notes:

- We use "@" to represent the zero pronoun. We use brackets to show that neither
  the @ nor が are literally present in the original sentence.

- The core clause is _read_ 「食べた」 -- the stuff in brackets is ignored.

  [Unless we are talking about _the diagram_ rather than the original sentence.
  In that case, it's helpful to say「『まるが』食べた」 with "air quotes" around
  the first bit.]

- This sentence does _not_ mean "I ate", nor does it mean "she ate", nor "it
  ate". Without additional context we simply don't know who or what's
  doing the eating, so we use &ldquo;@&rdquo; to fill in.
