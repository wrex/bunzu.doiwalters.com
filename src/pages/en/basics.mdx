Finally we can get to actually creating some diagrams!

Diagrams are intentionally very simple. You don't need any fancy software to
create them. The intent is to be able to create them with nothing more than a
pencil and paper (or chalk and chalkboard).

Step one couldn't be any easier:

<Admonition title="Step 1: Write down the original sentence">

Simply write the original sentence you plan to diagram at the top of the page.

Optionally, you can also write an English _transliteration_ for the sentence
immediately below the original. (More on this later.)

</Admonition>

## The core {文節}^(ぶんせつ) (clause)

Every sentence (in any language) has at least one clause (compound sentences might have multiple).

Every 文節 (clause) has a 主語 (subject) and a 述語 (predicate). There can be
many words (including complete clauses/phrases) that modify each of these, but
at the core of the sentence there will always be a 体言 acting as the subject,
and a 用言 acting as the predicate.

<Admonition title="Step 2: Core clause Baseline & separator">

First draw a horizontal line. This will act as a baseline for the subject and
predicate to rest on.

Then draw a vertical line to separate the subject from the predicate. This line
should extend above and below the baseline, and should be positioned somewhere
central.

Then write the _core_ 主語 to the left of the separator, and the core 述語
to the right.

</Admonition>

Let's start with an extremely simple example:

> {花}^(はな)が{咲}^(さ)いた ([the] flower bloomed)

There's obviously only one clause, and single words for both parts of that clause:

- The 主語 is the single word 花 (identified by the particle が). "I" is the master
  doing the action.

- The 述語 is the single verb 咲いた (the past tense of 咲く). The action was "bloomed".

Here is how we'd diagram that sentence:

<Figure figId="hanagasaita" caption="The flower bloomed">
  ![diagram for 'I ate'](/images/hanagasaita.png)
</Figure>

There are a few things to notice:

- If you ignore any lines or symbols and simply _read_ what's on the baseline, you get the
  core clause 「花が咲いた」. (The core clause happens to be the entire sentence in this
  example, but that won't usually be the case.)

- The particle が is explicitly included with the 主語 since it's literally
  present in the original sentence (が identifies subjects).

- This sentence doesn't use the plain or dictionary form of the 動詞　咲く, it
  uses an inflection (咲いた, the past tense). We use an optional dot to separate the stem of the verb
  from any 助動詞 (auxiliary verbs). The dot is optional and is a little
  different usage from most Japanese dictionaries (which sometimes use the dot
  to separate the kanji reading from the okurigana).

- If the sentence was 私が食べる ("I eat"), we _wouldn't_ use a dot. The
  predicate would just be 食べる (since that's what will be found in the dictionary).

### Other 用言 types

The 述語 (predicate) won't always be a 動詞 (verb). It could also be 形容詞 or
形容動詞. We might, for example have the sentences:

- 私が眠い (transliteration: "I am-sleepy")

- 彼が静かだ (transliteration: "He is-quiet")

We expressly transliterate the 用言 at the end of the sentences into
["is-verbs"](/en/yougen#is-verbs-not-adjectives) rather than "adjectives". We
are doing word-for-word **transliteration** rather than semantic translation
(English often requires us to reorder or add words to keep things
understandable, but transliterating this way reenforces the idea that
these _aren't_ adjectives, they are full predicates all on their own.)

The structure is identical (original sentences elided to save space):

<Figure figId="other-yougen" caption="Other 用言">
  ![other 用言 diagrams](/images/ex2-other-yougen.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- Since 形容詞 appear in the dictionary _with_ the い appended, we don't use a
  dot (the い isn't a particle).

- Since 形容動詞 _don't_ include the final だ in the dictionary, we use an optional dot
  between the 形容動詞 and the 助動詞 (auxiliary verb) だ.

- Note in particular that だ in that last example is part of the 形容動詞, but
  if it followed a noun it would technically be 助動詞, an _auxiliary_ verb.
  Here, it turns 静か into a 用言, but neither part is a verb, nor does either part function
  alone. _Both_ parts _together_ become a 用言 and form the predicate.

### Polite forms

So far we've used plain forms of the verbs. Using polite forms doesn't change much:

<Figure figId="polite-forms" caption="Polite forms">
  ![diagrams for polite forms](/images/ex3-polite-forms.png)
</Figure>

Again we've left out the original sentences since they are obvious, and again we
separate the dictionary forms with a dot. These are polite forms of 用言, but
nothing has changed structurally.

## Implied parts

Japanese sentences can leave out quite a bit and still remain fully grammatical
sentences. The entire subject or part of the predicate can be omitted and the
sentence will still make sense.

### Implied subjects

If all that's given is a 用言, then the subject is implied. As discussed in the
grammar section, [it's helpful to think of the zero pronoun filling in when the
subject is omitted](http://localhost:3000/en/bunsetsu#the-zero-pronoun).

Say, for example, the sentence was simply 「読む」(a verb meaning "read"). It isn't
explicit from the sentence who or what did the reading, so we use the zero
pronoun to stand in for "he" or "she" or "it":

<Figure figId="yomu" caption="The zero pronoun">
  ![diagram with the zero pronoun](/images/yomu.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- We use "@" to represent the zero pronoun. We use brackets to show that neither
  the @ nor が are literally present in the original sentence.

- The core clause along the baseline is still just the single word _read_ 「読む」 -- the stuff in
  brackets is ignored. [Unless we are talking _about the diagram_ rather than
  about the original sentence. In that case, it's helpful to say「『まるが』読む」 with
  "air quotes" around the first bit.]

- This sentence does _not_ mean "I read", nor does it mean "she reads", nor "it
  reads". Without additional context we simply don't know who or what's
  doing the reading, so we use &ldquo;@&rdquo; to fill in.

- As always, a clause _must_ have both a subject and a predicate, even if the
  subject is implied and not explicitly present.

### Implying _predicates_

As we also discussed
[previously](http://localhost:3000/en/bunsetsu#missing-%E8%BF%B0%E8%AA%9E), one can
create single-word sentences out of 体言 (basically nouns) or "adjectives".

Diagramming the examples from that section:

<Figure figId="cow-quiet-cold" caption="Implied predicates">
  ![Implied predicates](/images/ex5-cow-quiet-cold.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- Despite all the extra stuff in brackets, these diagrams simply display three
  _one-word_ sentences. We put things in brackets expressly to make the implied
  stuff _visible_. Structurally speaking, these implied parts are absolutely
  parts of the sentences.

  - 「牛」(transliterated: "@ is-cow")

  - 「静か」(transliterated: "@ is-quiet")

  - 「寒い」 (transliterated: "@ is-cold")

- The single words provided _must_ be interpreted as 用言 -- they form the
  _predicate_, not the subject.

- The zero object is the implied subject in all three sentences. There is no way to know
  from the original sentences alone if the subjects are "I", "he", "she", or
  "it". The semantic meaning comes from context.

- We _don't_ add an implied だ with 形容詞. The word 寒い is _already_ 用言. It
  doesn't need だ to turn it into one.

## 修飾語 (Modifiers)

Japanese has a wonderful system of [助詞 or
particles](http://localhost:3000/en/taigen#%E5%8A%A9%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%98%E3%82%87%E3%81%97-particles)
that explicitly inform us of what different parts of a sentence are doing. They
tell us if something is specifying a location, a starting point, an ending
point, a means of doing something, etc.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
The Japanese word for such modifiers is <ruby>修飾語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅうしょくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
The thing being modified is called <ruby>日修飾語<rp>(</rp>ひしゅうしょくご<rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

These modifiers don't actually change the meaning of the core clause, however.
They just provide more, finer-grained information.

<Admonition title="Step 3. Add any modifiers">
  Most sentences will be more complex than just a simple 主語 and a simple 述語.

Most will have various modifiers informing us of other things going on, or
different qualifiers for the subject and predicate.

Draw each modifier on a "hanger" hanging below the thing it's modifying. Place
them from left to right in the same order they appear in the original
sentence.

If there are any explicit particles identifying a modifier, write them on the
stem of the "hanger".

</Admonition>

### Object modifiers

One particularly interesting modifier is identified by the particle を. It
introduces a grammatical _object_, something the 述語 is acting on or with.

None of the example sentences so far have involved an object, so let's add an
one. Let's diagram "I read [a] _book_" (or, more
accurately, &ldquo;@ read [a] book&rdquo; with an implied "I").

<Figure figId="honwoyomu" caption="Objects">
  ![Objects](/images/honwoyomu.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- The original sentence in it's entirety is 「本を読む」, but the _core_
  clause is just 「読む」. It's the same structure we looked at earlier, but "book" just
  adds more information, it tells as _what_ is being read.

- An English _translation_ of that core clause is impossible without more context.
  We still don't know who or what read the book. We don't know whether to use a
  subject of "I", "he", "she", or "it". So we use the magic zero pronoun @
  instead.

- English sentence diagrams have a special notation for objects, but in Japanese
  grammatical objects identified with を are just a modifier like any other
  modifier (as we'll see). We dangle modifiers below whatever they
  modify/qualify.

- Unlike the stuff on the horizontal line (the _core_ of the clause) we don't
  include the particle with the word 本. Instead, we write the particle on the
  stem of the "hanger". This informs us what _type_ of modifying/qualifying is
  going on (sushi is the _grammatical object_ because of the を).

### Don't add imaginary modifiers

[As we described
earlier](/en/grammar-intro/#%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%80-predicate-words), English is an
"SVO" language. Not only does the verb go in the middle instead of at the end,
English rules _really_ encourage us to include an object, even when it isn't
strictly necessary.

Imagine this exchange between an English-speaking father and son:

> Father: "Who ate the last cookie?"
>
> Son: "I ate it."

Notice the word "it" at the end of the son's sentence.

Adding that word would be natural and automatic. Given the context, the son
would never reply with just the two words "I ate".[^1] He'd automatically add
the word "it" without conscious thought. Yet the question of _who_ is fully
answered with just "I ate" -- the object is irrelevant.

[^1]:
    Yes, he might answer "I did" because "did" is an intransitive verb that
    doesn't receive an object, but English _really_ wants us to add objects when
    we can to verbs like "ate" that are usually transitive.

There _are_ occasionally contexts where we'd use just "I ate" in English (after
being asked, "Did you eat?", for example). Most of the time, though, we
_automatically,_ unconsciously, add at least a pronoun as the object.

_But idiomatic Japanese **often** omits the object!_

In this exact same scenario, a Japanese son would reply,「私が食べた」or just 「食べた」.

In Japanese, it would actually sound a little weird (not _wrong_, but weird) to
include the object. It would sound wordy and
weirdly explicit for the son to say

> 「私があれを食べた」

or

> 「クーキーを食べた」

when just

> 「食べた」

suffices. The first version would sound weird _even though it is **exactly**
equivalent to "I ate it"._ We already _know_ we're talking about a cookie, so
why bother adding an object?[^2]

[^2]:
    Japanese also mixes subjects and objects in ways that seem
    weird to westerners. In Japanese,
    「クーキー**が**食べた」and「クーキーを食べた」are both ways of expressing
    roughly the same idea. The first uses が to mark the cookie as the _subject,_
    while the latter uses を to mark it as an object.

    The former means "**cookie** was eaten" while the latter means "[**I**] ate
    cookie". A cookie is consumed in both sentences, but the latter form places more
    emphasis on the person doing the eating, so would be more likely in this
    scenario (answering the question "who" not "what").

    English uses the form of the verb and the structure of the sentence to
    distinguish subject from object, while Japanese uses explicit _particles_ to
    make the distinction.

    In English, "was eaten" is very different than "eat" or "eats". But in
    Japanese the verb stays the same in all three instances, it's just たべる:

    - 「クーキーが食べる」"Cookie was eaten"

    - 「私がクーキーを食べる」"I eat cookie"

    - 「彼女がクーキーを食べる」"She eats cookie"

How _should_ we diagram the son's one-word reply?

We _could_ theoretically diagram the son's reply as:

<Figure caption='食べた as "I ate it" (BAD EXAMPLE!)'>
  ![食べた as "I ate it"](/images/ex8-I-ate-it.png)
</Figure>

But adding an entirely imaginary modifier when there really isn't an object in
the original sentence is _not_ correct. For one thing, two zero pronouns in one
clause is confusing (they probably don't refer to the same thing). For another,
how do we know that's what they meant? They might have intended a purely
intransitive sense of 食べた (like "I ate").

A diagram must _not_ invent things that might not have been intended. Sentence
diagrams _must not change just because the surrounding context changes._ The
identical diagram must apply whether the sentence is responding to "Who ate the
last cookie?" or to "Did you eat?".

The [original figure in the section on implied
subjects](/en/basics#fig_the-zero-pronoun) shows the correct way to diagram this
sentence. This sentence would still be transliterated as simply "[@] ate" or "[I]
ate" since that is all that's in the original sentence. Even though it's not
spoke out loud or written down, there _is_ a logical subject (the zero pronoun),
but **there is no object in that sentence.**

It's _English_ rules that make us want to add an explicit object, but we are
diagramming Japanese sentences, so "objectless" sentences are perfectly
acceptable and common even with transitive verbs.

In other words: It's correct and necessary to add imaginary _subjects_ because
every 文節 _must_ have a logical subject, but don't add imaginary _objects_ or
other modifiers to a Japanese sentence diagram. Only diagram the modifiers that
are actually present in the original sentence.

### Other modifiers

Modifiers can affect the subject as well as the predicate. They can even modify
other modifiers.

Let's take an example with lots of (albeit) modifiers:

<Figure figId="white-dog-eating" caption="Several modifiers">
  ![Several modifiers](/images/ex7-white-dog-eating.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- The _core_ of this longer sentence is just 「犬が食べている」.

- Modifiers hang below the things they modify in the same order as they appear
  in the original sentence. The sentence starts with 白い so it attaches to the left
  of the subject.

  Note, however, that the explicit particles in Japanese _allow
  modifiers to be moved around at will in a sentence,_ but in a diagram, they
  always hang from the things they modify.

  The sentence 「白い犬が静かに家の中で食べている」has precisely the same
  semantic meaning as the original, despite swapping the order of the middle
  modifiers. The swapped modifiers would still hang below the 述語 since that's
  what they modify (but we'd normally swap their order in the diagram as well
  for clarity).

- We don't attach a particle to the stem for the modifier 白い. 形容詞 can also
  modify 体言 as well as acting as the 述語, but they don't need a particle. They
  always confer a sense of nature or state. So the stem of the first modifier
  remains bare.

  (The word 白い really _is_ an "adjective" here, but it's still better to consider
  it an example of the 形容詞 part of speech. It's just a modifier like all the
  others.)

- All of the other modifiers have explicit particles indicating what type of
  modifying/qualifying is happening.

  The _location_ is "inside" ([indicated by
  で](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/particle-de/#for-specifying-places)).

  The eating is happening "quietly" ([indicated by
  に](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/particle-ni/#adj---adverb)).

  Western grammarians tend to think of particles like に here _changing_ the
  grammatical function of the "な-adjective" 静か from an adjective into an adverb.

  The author finds it easier to think of 静か as _always and forever 形容動詞._ It
  doesn't matter whether it used in a predicate or as a particle-identified
  modifier for something else, it's just a 形容動詞 specifying a state or condition
  just like they always do.

  This is the Japanese way to think about the grammar.

- Multiple modifiers affecting the same thing are placed next to each other (中
  で and 静かに both affect the predicate, so they are next to each other on the
  same row).

- Modifiers can also "stack" (modifiers can modify other modifiers). The noun 家
  (いえ, meaning house) is modifying "inside". The particle の indicates which
  particular inside we are talking about.

- Each row of modifiers adds a little more information to the core clause, but
  still forms complete, grammatical sentences:

  - The core clause reads 「犬が食べている」

  - With the next row of modifiers, it reads: 「白い犬が中で静かに食べている」

  - With the final row, we get back to the original sentence: 「白い犬が家の中で
    静かに食べている」

#### Even verbs can be 修飾語 (modifiers)

Here's an interesting example:

> 「{歩}^(ある)く{習慣}^(しゅうかん)を{身}^(み)につける」

We'd normally translate this into English as "[I] acquire the
walking habit".

<Figure figId="arukushuukann" caption="歩く習慣を身につける">
  ![Figure for "I acquire the walking habit"](/images/arukushuukan.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- The core clause is simply 「つける」(normally this means "[I] attach", but
  here it's closer to "[I] acquire"). The colloquial expression 「身につける」,
  however, means to develop a habit. Literally, it means attaching something to
  your body (effectively making it mindless and automatic).

- Adding one level of modifiers, we get 「習慣をつける」 or "[I] attach
  custom/habit".

- But it's not just any custom/habit, it's specifically the habit of _walking_.
  Note how the modifier here is a pure 動詞, 歩く.

Here's an even more interesting example of using a verb as a modifier,

> 「{早}^(はや)く{起}^(お)きるように{努力}^(どりょく)する」

We'd translate this into English as something like "I endeavor to wake early",
but structurally that is _very_ different than the literal Japanese. This
English translation is a compound sentence that uses "wake" as a verb.

In the Japanese sentence, 起きる (wake) is a _modifier_, what we'd call an
"adverb" in English, affecting 努力する ("to endeavor") which itself is a
動詞 (a verb, albeit a special kind of "suru" verb).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Figure figId="hayakuokiru" caption="早く起きるように努力する">
  ![Figure for "I endeavor to wake early"](/images/hayakuokiru.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- The core clause is simply 「努力する」("[@] endeavors").

- 「起きる」is a 動詞, a verb, but with the「〜ように」here, it's acting as 修飾語 (a modifier,
  effectively an adverb).

- Further, 「早く」is also acting to modify/qualify the verb 起きる.
