Everything on this site represents the _author's_ understanding of how Japanese
grammar works. Ultimately, this site presents an _opinion_. As the old joke
goes: if you don't like this opinion, he has others!

More seriously, if you do disagree with anything here, please let the author
know. But please provide examples and use evidence-based reasoning rather than
merely complaining with statements like "That's wrong!" or "That's a confusing
way to think about it". There's usually a reason things are presented as they
are.

Arguments are unlikely to sway the author's opinion unless they provide concrete
examples demonstrating errors or inconsistencies. Neither appeals to authority
("so-and-so says _this_") nor technical jargon ("declinations with the
subjunctive mood ...") are likely to persuade. Examples, please.

## Linguistics and grammar

Academic linguists study every language spoken on earth (and then some). They've
had to develop a sort of "meta-language" to describe the differences and
similarities across countless languages. (The author calls this meta-language
"linguistic-grammarian".) The words in this language have very specific
meanings and can be used to describe _any_ language.

Learning this meta-language is an incredibly difficult undertaking!

## For laymen not linguists

As a layman, trying to follow and understand two linguists describing
aspects of an unfamiliar language can be an exercise in frustration. The
conversations are full of arcane grammatical jargon and extremely nuanced points
that can be quite hard to grasp. ("It's all Greek to me" doesn't
begin to cover it!)

Fortunately, our needs are at least _slightly_ more modest: we only wish to diagram
sentences in _one_ language: Japanese.

Further, we _presume_ at least a basic level of Japanese language skills.
Specifically, readers should know at least a hundred or so simple Japanese words
and be able to construct _basic_ Japanese sentences. Readers should possess
something like a young, native child's capability in the language (but with
adult understanding of concepts).

We're also only diagramming structure (syntax), not meaning (semantics). One
doesn't need a deep, nuanced understanding of Japanese to make sense of these
diagrams, but the words themselves should help to explain the ideas displayed by
a diagram (how the words are used and what affects what).

As long as you can recognize "things" vs. "actions/existence" vs. "modifiers",
the diagrams should make some sense.

This _doesn't_ mean it's easy to _create_ accurate diagrams, though!

Japanese grammar and syntax is quite complex in its own right. It often differs
from English grammar in quite subtle ways.

Worse, explaining things in one language by using another can introduce all sorts of
unintended confusion. Like it or not, the languages we speak literally train
the neural pathways in our brains. We tend to "think" in our own languages even
when attempting to learn or teach another -- this often causes confusion.

True fluency requires "thinking" in the target languages, something we hope to
encourage with these diagrams.

## Japanese terminology

While the diagrams themselves will _never_ contain any grammatical jargon in
either language, we are forced to use grammatical terminology to explain how
they are constructed.

Because English and Japanese grammatical terms can have subtly different
meanings, _this site always prefers the Japanese terms_! Whenever possible, we
also provide English equivalents or translations, but when the meanings differ,
no matter how subtly, we **always** intend the Japanese word and the Japanese
meaning.

### Case in point

{/* prettier-ignore */}
The English word "noun" and the Japanese word <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> mean exactly the same thing:
they are "named things". "Verb" and <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are also
almost identical.

But what most English-language sources call "adjectives" in Japanese
behave strangely indeed compared to their English equivalents.

For one thing, Japanese has
_two_ types of "adjectives": <ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
and <ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

For another, Japanese grammar resources say these types of words describe action or
state in _predicate_ of a sentence. They think of all three as _verb-like,_ as
first-class words that form the predicate of a sentence.

More to the point, they _don't_ think of 形容詞 and 形容動詞 as second-class words that
merely _modify_ nouns. They _don't_ think of them primarily as "adjectives" that merely
_modify_ subjects and objects.

Don't believe it? Consider the following:

Japanese dictionaries and grammar resources usually identify 形容動詞 as
"**だ**-words", but we consider them "**な**-words"!

They think of them _first_ as <ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
or verb-like (e.g. 「静か**だ**」&mdash; "it's quiet"). We think of them first as
adjective-like (e.g. 「静か**な**家」&mdash; "a quiet house").

This was a bit of an epiphany for the author. It's why this site uses Japanese
terms whenever possible.

The goal, as much as possible, is to _think about Japanese sentences like a
Japanese native_.

## Why study grammar/syntax?

We all learned our native languages primarily by _immersion_ (repeated exposure
and mimicry). We didn't study grammar and "rules" until fairly late in our childhood.

The human brain is _incredibly_ well adapted to pattern matching. With
sufficient _input_ and practice, we _can_ reach even fairly advanced levels of
proficiency _without_ studying grammar or formally studying how sentences are
structured.

_Nothing_ is more beneficial to learning a language than massive amounts of
_input_ (listening or reading) and plenty of practice with feedback.

Yet most if not all countries force their schoolchildren to learn more about
their native languages. Students learn to think _about_ their native languages.
Most educated people eventually study grammar, composition, and classic
literature at some point.

So why do we force our children to study grammar?

Studying the structure of our languages allows us to communicate more
effectively and to express more nuanced thoughts. "Ungrammared" is almost as
much an impediment to communicating complex thoughts as "illiterate".

While "he done it" would likely be understood, it sounds unrefined.

In the same way, 「その花がきれい！」 (without だ at the end) or 「あの家が白いだ」(_with_ だ at the
end) communicates the ideas effectively enough, but they are _wrong_, they sound
unfinished/awkward/unrefined and such mistakes in more complex sentences
eventually create difficulties.

These types of mistakes eventually tend to fade with sufficient input: your
brain eventually pattern-matches and rejects things that "sound wrong". Studying
grammar and syntax speed up the process considerably, however!

The diagraming techniques taught here provide a visual aid for reasoning
about and composing Japanese sentences. They visually clarify grammatical syntax
and structure.

Still, if you don't value grammar, then you probably won't find sentence diagrams or
this site terribly useful. (And you'd be _wrong_. 😉)

## Learn like a native

This site attempts to teach Japanese grammatical syntax similar to how it would
be taught to Japanese <ruby>中学生<rp>(</rp><rt>ちゅうがくせい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(middle-school students). But it only attempts to explain enough basic grammar
to diagram Japanese sentences &mdash; it's not a complete course in Japanese grammar!

Much of the information presented is cribbed from [this wonderful site about
Japanese grammar](https://www.kokugobunpou.com/).

Because this is a site for _foreign_ learners of Japanese, however, some
concessions, alterations, and omissions are inevitable.

Whenever possible, concepts are introduced in the same order as a _Japanese_
middle-school curriculum. The information is hierarchically organized using
_Japanese_ taxonomies.

Concepts are generally described with as _Japanese_ a mindset as the Author's
English-native brain can provide.

Ultimately, though, this site aims at _foreign_ learners of the Language
(English speakers, specifically). Some concessions, omissions, and even
additions are inevitable as we try to help foreigners get over some
pre-conceptions from their own native languages.

In particular, Native Japanese grammar resources don't usually teach a ["zero
pronoun"](/en/grammar/7-construction#the-zero-pronoun). Nor do they insist that
every clause [_always_ has logical
subject](/en/grammar/1-foundations#subjects-and-predicates), even if unstated.
But few natives would argue these points once explained, and they demonstrably
help many foreign learners to better understand Japanese sentences.
