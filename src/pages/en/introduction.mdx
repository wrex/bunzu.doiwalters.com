<Admonition title="Warning!">
This site is still a work in progress — a very early stage of progress.

The author is no expert in either the Japanese language or grammar. The process
of _creating_ this system helped him to learn quite a bit (it took a _lot_ of
discussion with more knowledgeable people). Regardless, errors are still likely.

Proceed with caution!

</Admonition>

This site explains how to create _sentence diagrams_ for Japanese sentences.

Sentence diagrams are simple "stick diagrams" that show the functional,
grammatical _structure_ of individual sentences. They are a teaching tool and
don't require any software or special tools to create (hand-drawn diagrams are fine).

It's targeted at _intermediate_ Japanese learners who wish to better understand
the grammatical structure of Japanese sentences.

This site does _not_ attempt to teach the Japanese language or grammar, it only
introduces a tool to aid further study.

## What's a Sentence Diagram?

Americans of a certain age might remember diagramming sentences while learning
English grammar in primary school.

The author was one of those annoying nerdy kids who loved them! He wondered if
it wouldn't be possible to create something similar for Japanese sentences.

_Sentence diagrams_ display the _structure_ of sentences to language
learners, without resorting to arcane grammatical jargon. They _visually_
display the internal structure of a sentence, breaking them into simple pieces
that show how a sentence _works_. They show the _core_ of the sentence, as
well as which parts modify or further describe which other parts.

They _don't_ explain precisely what a sentence _means_ however (you still need
to understand the meaning of the Japanese words they contain).

_Anyone_ with a minimal understanding of English can view an English sentence
diagram and immediately understand the basic information presented, even if they
don't know a noun from a verb.

Here's an example (using English sentence diagrams that won't be explained further):

<Figure caption="Sample English sentence diagram">
  ![Sample Diagram](/images/english-diagram.png)
</Figure>

The original sentence is shown at the top: "Japanese people eat meals at home
with pointy sticks".

The large horizontal line shows that the fundamental "core" of that sentence is
"People eat meals".

The _subject_, _verb_, and _object_ in that core sentence are indicated by the
vertical lines that separate them, but _you don't need to understand those words_ to
understand the diagram! You only need to understand the few simple words present
on that line in the diagram.

The diagram clearly shows that the "action" part of the sentence ("eat") is
modified by a bunch of other words. They eat "at home" and "with sticks".

The word "pointy" modifies or further describes the word "sticks". Similarly,
the word "Japanese" modifies "people".

## Syntax, not semantics

Note that sentence diagrams make no attempt to explain what a sentence _means_.
They only display how the various parts go together _structurally_. The linguistic/grammatical
jargon for this distinction is "semantics" (what it means) vs. "syntax" (the
structure).

Sentence diagrams _only_ show syntax. On their own, **they cannot explain subtle
differences in nuance or meaning**!

If the English sentence above was rewritten as:

> At home, Japanese people eat their meals with pointy sticks

the diagram would be _identical_ even though it has a slightly different nuance.

The diagram for this reordered sentence would be absolutely identical
because the sentence _structure_, what modifies what, remains the same.

But the reordering imparts a different _nuance_: This new version emphasizes
"_at home_" more than "Japanese people" (possibly implying that they use their
hands or knives and forks elsewhere &mdash; how rude!).

That's a semantic difference, not a syntactic difference. It isn't represented
_at all_ in a sentence diagram.

## Why diagram?

There are two primary reasons to diagram:

1. **Viewing** provides a vehicle for further discussion: for _teaching_. A
   teacher might, for example, want to contrast two different ways to express
   something (with different sentences/diagrams). Alternately, they might just want to
   show correct and incorrect ways to parse a given sentence.

2. **Creating** diagrams provides a tool for students to decipher potentially complex
   sentences on their own. Creating sentence diagrams is an excellent way for
   beginners to reason about a sentence and better understand how the grammar
   _works_.

## 文章図式 <small>(Japanese sentence diagrams)</small>

This site is for English-speakers trying to learn _Japanese_. It describes a
system to create _Japanese_ sentence diagrams, or 文章図式 (pronounced
"bunshouzushiki"). The author hopes that Japanese sentence diagrams will help
other beginners to better understand the language.

The Japanese word for "sentence" is <ruby>文章<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんしょう </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (bunshou, literally "writing section"). One word for diagram is <ruby>図式<rp>(</rp><rt>ずしき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(zushiki, literally "diagram method"). "Bunshouzushiki" s quite a lot to
type in Roman characters, so this site omits the "shou" and and the "shiki" and just
calls them "bunzu" (文図) for short.

## Minimal jargon, but Japanese jargon

The author has done his best to avoid technical jargon whenever possible, but it's impossible to
describe how to _create_ these diagrams without resorting to grammatical terminology at
many points.

Whenever possible, this site uses _Japanese_ grammatical terms (with translations)
rather than the English terms alone. For example,

{/* prettier-ignore */}
> <ruby>猫<rp>(</rp><rt>ねこ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (neko or "cat") is a <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(meishi or "noun").

The reason is that there are often subtle differences between the Japanese and
English concepts. Ultimately the grammar terms are just names for concepts.
Since the Japanese concepts are intended, it makes sense to use the Japanese
terms rather than force-fitting the English terms.

The word "noun" means pretty much exactly the same thing as 名詞 (a "named part of
speech") but this _won't_ always be the case. "Adjectives", for example are a
whole 'nother ball of wax.

## Some Japanese required

This site is aimed at "intermediate" Japanese learners (whatever "intermediate"
means).

While it hopes to prove useful even for beginners, it does assume some basic knowledge about
the language.

Just as an 11-year-old studying grammar for the first time _already speaks their
native language to some degree_, these diagrams also presume a minimal familiarity
with Japanese (though less than an 11-year-old Japanese native might possess!).

In particular, some familiarity with the writing systems is mandatory. You
should be able to [read
hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana-book-pdf/) and
[katana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana-book-pdf/) (the phonetic
writing systems). The linked
resources from Tofugu are excellent, and should suffice for much of the content
here.

It's _hard_ to make sense of Japanese sentences using hiragana and katakana
alone, however (not to mention space-consuming). So most of the example
sentences use at least some kanji (Chinese pictographic characters).

Whenever possible, this site uses common words and simple sentences, but readers
must at least know a few hundred common words and be able to construct very
basic sentences in Japanese.

The author recommends getting through at least the first three (free!) levels on
[https://wanikani.com](Wanikani) (or something equivalent) before attempting to
use this site.

Note that the diagrams themselves don't use furigana (small hiragana/katakana
characters above the kanji). Unfortunately, it's painful to create furigana
with the [diagramming software used for this site](https://figma.com).

It _is_ relatively straightforward to create furigana in `HTML` pages, however,
so these web pages use furigana everywhere _except_ in the diagrams themselves
(as well as providing English translations as much as possible). Furigana
becomes a bit of an eyesore if overused, however, so it's often ommited upon
repeated usage of the same words.

Romaji (phonetic roman characters for Japanese words like "bunshou" and
"zushiki" above) are _only_ used on this introductory page. The remainder of
this site will only uses furigana.
