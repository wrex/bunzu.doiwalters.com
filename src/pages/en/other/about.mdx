This site was inspired by a thread on the [Wanikani community
forum](https://community.wanikani.com) that mentioned another grammatical
diagramming technique called ["tree
diagrams"](https://blog.ung.edu/press/a-linguists-tree-of-knowledge/).

The author found tree diagrams difficult to create and understand because they depended
heavily on technical grammatical jargon.

But they reminded him of how much he enjoyed creating [sentence
diagrams](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/sentence-diagramming/) in primary
school. He wondered if it wouldn't be possible to create something similar for
Japanese that.

Shortly afterword, he started a different thread to translate {川柳}^(せんりゅう) (a sort of
light-hearted, comedic haiku). Several times he wished for some sort of diagram
to discuss the more interesting points of the grammar contained. In particular,
he wanted to highlight the impact of _topics_ vs. _subjects_ and the function of
_the zero pronoun_.

The goal was to create something as easy to understand as English sentence
diagrams. Something that made the internal structure of Japanese sentences
visible, without relying on technical jargon.

After countless long and tedious conversations with _many_ much more knowledgeable
friends on the forum, he eventually learned enough to come up with the system
documented here.

## Site details

This site was created using the wonderful static site generator
[Astro](https://astro.build/) with the `docs` theme. Several components were
written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) to render diagrams, etc.

All content was written in Markdown using the [MDX
plugin](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) with
[remark-ruby]() installed to make it easier to add furigana to Japanese
sentences.

All [the source code for this
site](https://github.com/wrex/bunzu.doiwalters.com) is available online (see the
links in the sidebar).

## The author

Rex Walters is a US Navy brat who's first exposure to Japan was in the mid
1970's when his father moved the family to Hayama in Kanagawa prefecture. He's
now married to a Japanese native with three completely bilingual adult children
(two of whom currently reside in Japan).

Although he's been speaking Japanese (poorly) for many years, thanks to
[Wanikani](https://wanikani.com) he's recently learned how to _read_ the
language. It turns out that being illiterate was holding him back (who could
have known?).

## Acknowledgements

This site wouldn't have been possible without the help of too many to list.

The author would particularly like to thank his family for their patient
corrections and constant assistance. They have to be tired of explaining the
semantic and grammatical nuances of various 川柳！

He'd also like to thank the fine folks at [Tofugu](https://tofugu.com) and their
love child [Wanikani](https://wanikani.com). Without them, he'd never have
learned how to read and better understand this crazy language.

Lastly, he'd like to thank all of his forum friends that taught him so much and
made this learning process so enjoyable:

In no particular order, _THANK YOU_ to rfindley, alo, bakugames,
ChristopherFritz, Jonapedia, yamitenshi, Gorbit99, wct, Chocobits (who taught me
the opposite of clickbait is "clickyeet"!), fallynleaf, Kumirei, Leebo, ekg,
trunklayer, NicoleRauch, superelf94, Myria, enbyboiwonder, KJules, Daisoujou,
Uint2048, Sinyavasen, Hubbit200, Amimononohitsuji, GearAid, OwenDG, LaVieQ,
tiredkiwi, and especially pm215, denzo, Arzar33, and Myria (who were all
_incredibly_ patient with both the author's questions and his weird ideas).

Apologies to the many who were unintentionally left off the list -- the author's
memory isn't what it once was!
