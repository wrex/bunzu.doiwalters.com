Every fully-formed 文 (sentence) contains at least one 文節 (clause). Many only
have one, but complex sentences might have many.

**Every** clause comprises exactly two parts:

> **Important Rule #1:**
>
> _Every_ clause **always** has a logical <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
> (subject) and <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
> (predicate)!

These two parts form the framework of every clause.

## 主語 (subjects)

The 主語 answers _who_ or _what_. The character 主 ("master") provides a clue: The
主語 is the "master" of the clause: it's performs an action, or simply _exists_
in some state of being.

The 主語 is usually identified by the
<ruby>助詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (particle)「が」that
immediately follows.

One point of confusion for foreign learners: The 主語 is often
_omitted_ in speech or writing. It's often _implied_ from prior context, or
something outside of the sentence itself.

For example, imagine if someone pointed at a flower and uttered the single word sentence:

> <ruby>咲 <rp>(</rp><rt>さ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いている。("blooming")

In Japanese, that is a complete, grammatical, single-clause sentence.

The intended subject of that sentence is obviously _flower_. They are pointing out that _the
flower_ is blooming.

But that's the _semantic_ (logical) 主語 &mdash; there _is no_ syntactical
(literal) 主語 anywhere in the sentence. But it's a complete Japanese sentence
nonetheless!

> **Important rule #2:**
>
> 主語 are often omitted in writing or speech, but _something_ **always** _acts_
> as the "master" in **every** clause, even if isn't explicitly mentioned.

Since sentence diagrams are all about _syntax,_ this last rule presents a bit of quandary.

If every clause has a subject, and we wish to diagram complete clauses, what do we do
we display when the subject is only a semantic, logical implication, and doesn't
literally appear? How do we show that the subject comes from outside the
sentence itself?

### Subjectless clauses

If asked to translate the sentence「咲いている」into English, we'd write "**It's**
blooming".

English grammar _requires_ an explicit subject to form a grammatical
clause, so we (somewhat unconsciously) add the word "it".

Whether we realize it or not, we've trained our brains to _always_ include at
least a pronoun so that there is a subject in _every_ English clause.

But there is no Japanese word for "it" explicitly present in the original
sentence! We've completely imagined an explicit subject ("it") out of thin air
and added it to our translation.

The word "it" doesn't even add any information to the sentence! It
just informs us of something we already knew: _something_ is acting as the
subject.

English grammar rules _mandate_ an explicit subject ("it"), but Japanese grammar
rules simply don't.

To completely beat the point into the ground: We _could_ effectively and
completely communicate the idea that a flower is blooming by pointing to it
and _saying_ "blooming".

We might even think that in our heads. But actually uttering a solitary word
like that sounds like a crazy person talking to themselves. We _automatically_
say, "**it's** blooming" when talking to someone else.

A Japanese person would just say「咲いている」. They don't need to prefix it with
something like「あれが」because _Japanese grammar automatically **implies** a pronoun
when if subject is omitted._

> **Important rule #3a**
>
> Japanese grammar automatically **implies** a pronoun if the subject is omitted.

To summarize:

Both "it's blooming" and「咲いている」are fully grammatical sentences in their
respective languages, but "blooming" is _not_ a grammatical clause in English.

Using proper grammar in either language makes us seem less crazy to others when
communicating!

### The zero pronoun

Many foreign learners find it easier to imagine a magical "zero pronoun" acting as
the syntactic 主語 when it is omitted. It's a "zero" pronoun because it's not spoken out
loud, nor does it ever appear in writing (though we _will_ show it in diagrams!).

The zero pronoun acts like any other pronoun (e.g. he, she, they, it, etc.): it
stands in for something else. It's a _magic_ pronoun, though, because it
can act like _any_ other pronoun, standing in for literally anything.

If the context is a flower, it means "it". If the context is the author, it
means "I". If the context is the author's mother, it means "she".

The zero pronoun is an important but admittedly nebulous _semantic_ concept. In
order to make it obvious that Japanese clauses _also_ always have a subject,
though, we will make the zero pronoun explicit in our diagrams.

Japanese sentence diagrams use the symbol "@" to represent the zero pronoun.

When we hear or read a sentence like 「咲いている」, it's quite helpful for
English speakers to _imagine_ that the sentence read:

> [＠が]　咲いている

The stuff in brackets is only imaginary. They _aren't_ really in the sentence.
They aren't pronounced when the sentence is read aloud, nor do they appear when
written. They will only ever appear in sentence _diagrams_ and in examples like
this one.

Occasionally, though, we'll want to talk _about_ an example like this, or about a
sentence _diagram_ rather than the sentence itself. In that case, the author has
taken to saying「まる」(as in an empty circle: ◯) instead of "zero pronoun". If
forced to read the above example out loud, for example, he'd say
「まるが　さいている」(perhaps putting "air quotes" around the stuff in brackets).

> **Important rule #3:**
>
> _Japanese clauses do not require an explicit 主語_. The subject can be
> _implied_. When it's left out, imagine the "zero pronoun" in its place.

## 述語 (predicates)

The 述語 specifies _what is done,_ or _how, in what way_, it's done. It comes
at the end of the clause.

> **Important rule #4:**
>
> 述語 are **always** at the very end of a clause.

Example:

> <ruby>鳥<rp>(</rp><rt>とり</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　が　<ruby>鳴<rp>(</rp><rt>な</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く
> ("[the] bird chirps")

The 主語 in this sentence is 鳥 (bird). The 述語 is 鳴く(to chirp).

In addition to the 主語 and 述語, there are three other functional components
that can appear in 文節:

## 修飾語

<ruby>修飾語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅうしょくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _modifiers_
or qualifiers affecting something else.

For example, in the (subjectless) clause:

> ゆっくり 歩く ("Walk slowly")

the word ゆっくり (slowly) is 修飾語 (a modifer) and <ruby>歩<rp>(</rp><rt>ある
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く (to walk) is the 述語.

#### 接続語

<ruby>接続語<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _conjunctives_
that connect clauses.

For example:

> 安いのに、おいしい ("Even though [it's] cheap, [it's] delicious")

Here, のに ("even though") is 接続語 (a connective or conjunctive) between two
different (single word) clauses: <ruby>安<rp>(</rp><rt>やす
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い ("cheap") and おいしい ("delicious").

Note that _both_ clauses have "omitted" the subject. It's actually the same implied
subject in both clauses (whatever food they are talking about).

#### 独立語

<ruby>独立語<rp>(</rp><rt>どくりつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _independent,
standalone_ words (interjections and exclamations).

The serve almost no functional/structural purpose. We can mostly ignore them
when it comes to diagramming.

Example:

> さあ、やろう ("C'mon! Let's go")

The word さあ ("C'mon", "well", "Allright") is 独立語 a standalone word. The
real clause (again subject-less) is やろう ("Let [us] go").
