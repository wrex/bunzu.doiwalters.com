To an English-speaking layman, the words "topic" and "subject" seem pretty much
identical. They both can mean "what we're currently discussing".

Grammarians, though, make a distinction:

- The grammatical _subject_ refers to the "doer" in a clause. The Japanese word
  for "subject" is [主語](/en/bunsetsu#%E4%B8%BB%E8%AA%9E-subjects). It's the
  "master" that is doing whatever is indicated by the predicate. (The predicate
  specifies whether the "master" is performing an action or just "existing" in
  some state.)

- The word _topic_ is reserved for "what we're currently discussing". It
  simply provides overall context. A _topic_ might be explicit (actually
  mentioned within a sentence) or implicit (from prior sentences or based on
  where a conversation is occurring).

  A sentence might mean different things in different contexts. The _topic_
  clarifies what specific meaning was intended.

English doesn't use _explicit_ topics very often. When we do, it's usually with
a construct like:

> As for ◯, ...

or

> Regarding ◯, ...

The _topic_ is whatever was in the circle.

Japanese, however, uses explicit topics
(<ruby>題目<rp>(</rp><rt>だいもく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) _all the time._ This leads to
much confusion for English-speaking language learners, since even extremely
simple and incredibly common sentences contain explicit _topics_ but only
implicit _subjects_.

## I am American

Take this extremely simple, common sentence:

> 私はアメリカ人です

Most people would translate that into English as "I am an American".

_Semantically_, that would be absolutely correct. That's what the sentence
_means_.

Structurally, though, that's not what the sentence actually _says_!

A more literal _transliteration_ (vs. translation) for this sentence would be:

> As for _me_, @ is-American-person

The character 私 in this sentence is the 題目 (_topic_) "me" and _not_ the grammatical
subject. The _topic_ is "me," the _logical_ subject is "I", and the literal,
_syntactical_ subject that would go on a diagram is _the zero pronoun!_

<Admonition title="Important">

The particle は **never**, repeat _never,_ identifies the grammatical subject!

It quite often introduces a _topic_ that _implies_ a subject, but it never
indicates the subject itself.

An explicit subject for a clause will only be identified by the particle が,
never by は.

This is how we'd diagram this sentence:

<Figure figId="I-am-American" caption='"I am an American" in Japanese'>
  ![Sentence diagram for "I am an American"](/images/I-am-American.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- Semantically, this sentence simply _means_ "I am an American", but that's _not_ what it
  literally says!

  The semantic meaning, the _translation,_ is idiomatic and correct in _both_
  directions. If someone asked to _translate_ "I am an American" into Japanese,
  then 「私はアメリカ人です」 is a perfectly correct response. But a strict
  _transliteration_ would be different.

- Syntactically, there is quite a bit more going on under the covers. The
  diagram makes the hidden parts visible:

  - The _topic_ is "me" (not "I"). We diagram topics with dotted lines
    connecting to the clauses they affect.

  - The _subject_ ([主語](/en/bunsetsu#%E4%B8%BB%E8%AA%9E-subjects)) is the zero pronoun, @, standing in for "I".

  - The _predicate_ ([述語](/en/bunsetsu#%E8%BF%B0%E8%AA%9E-predicates)) is アメリカ人です.

    - アメリカ人 is a 名詞 (noun) meaning American-person. We could just shorten
      this to "American" since it mostly means the same thing, but
      American-person disambiguates from things like "American" music (アメリカの音楽).

    - です is a 助動詞 (auxiliary verb) acting as a _copula._

      - 助動詞 never work on their own, they are _auxiliary_ words that must always
        attach to other words.

      - A copula _couples_ the preceding noun to the subject. In this case, it says that the
        subject (@) _is_ an American person.

    - The combination of 名詞＋助動詞 forms a [用言](/en/grammar-intro#%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%80-predicate-words). It's correct to think of
      アメリカ人です as one grammatical unit, an "is-verb". We use the "dictionary dot" to
      separate the two words you'd find separately in a dictionary, but it's
      best to think of things like 静かだ and アメリカ人です as single
      grammatical units, as ["is-verbs"](/en/yougen#is-verbs-not-adjectives).

- The "core" clause of the sentence is just アメリカ人です
  ("is-American-person"). The topic is not part of the core clause.

- If we were to read the entire transliteration aloud, it would be: "me,
  is-American-Person". As always, we skip over the stuff in brackets.

- But those bracketed parts _really are_ part of the sentence!

  - The topic _is_ "me". In English, we'd typically introduce this topic by
    saying "As for me", not just "me". In Japanese, the particle は suffices.

  - The subject really is part of the clause, it's just implied. The sentence
    「私は彼がアメリカ人です」 ("As for me, he is an American person") _sounds_
    weirdly verbose but is just as grammatically correct and has the identical
    semantic meaning.

- Exposing all this hidden complexity for such a simple sentence probably seems
  counter-productive. But this is exactly how this sentence actually _works._
  Exposing this complexity in a diagram this way pays dividends once we start
  analyzing more complex sentences.

## Topics and subjects can differ

In 私はアメリカ人です, the topic and the subject were the same human being (私).
That won't always be the case.

Take, for example, the English sentence "Every Sunday, my father makes sushi".
Here, the topic is "Sunday" but the subject of the primary clause is "my
father".

In Japanese:

<Figure figId="weekly-sushi" caption="Every Sunday, my father makes sushi">
  ![Diagram for "Every Sunday, my father makes sushi"](/images/weekly-sushi.png)
</Figure>

Notes:

- The topic is the long, compound-word 毎週日曜日. We've diagrammed this as a
  single compound 名詞 (noun) meaning "every Sunday" in English.

  The first character is a prefix meaning "every". The next character means
  "week". The final three characters are another 名詞 meaning "Sunday". All
  together it expresses the semantic concept "every week Sunday" or just "every Sunday".

  When kanji are just jammed together like this, where each part sequentially
  qualifies the next without any particles in between, it's easiest to think of
  them as just a single compound noun (which we've transliterated here as
  "every-Sunday").

  If the sentence had started 毎週**の**日曜日は〜, we would have shown 毎週 as a modifier hanging below the
  topic of 日曜日. Since there is no intervening particle, we've chosen to diagram
  it as a compound-noun instead.

- The core clause is お父さんが作る ("father makes"). The subject is お父さん (father) and the
  predicate is 作る (make).

- There is an explicit object in this example, 寿司, introduced with the
  particle を, so we hang it below the predicate. "Father makes sushi".
