## Units of composition

These are the basic units or divisions of Japanese writing, from largest to
smallest:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{文章}^(ぶんしょう)</span>
  <div>
    #### Writing in general

    An article, composition, essay, or, an individual _sentence._

  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{段落}^(だんらく)</span>
  <div>
    #### A paragraph 
    
    Literally, "falling columns" of text.
  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{文}^(ぶん)</span>
  <div>
    #### A sentence 
    
    Something that can be delimited with a period.
  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{文節}^(ぶんせつ)</span>
  <div>
    #### A clause 
    
    An individual clause or phrase within a sentence.
  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{単語}^(たんご)</span>
  <div>
    #### An individual word.
  </div>
</Definition>

We are only concerned with 文, 文節, and 単語 (sentences, clauses/phrases, and
words). In particular, identifying the "core" 文節 in a sentence is the most
critical part of diagramming.

One caution: while the term 文章 is often translated as the English word "sentence",
the word 文 more accurately reflects the English concept of a sentence
(something that ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation point).

## 文節 (clause) sub-parts

### Subjects and predicates

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (clauses) are _by far_ the most
important grammatical constructs when diagramming.

Every fully-formed 文 (sentence) contains at least one 文節 (clause). Many _only_
have one, but complex sentences might have many.

Every 文節 contains two parts:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{主語}^(しゅご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Subject

    This is the "master" of a clause. It's the _doer_ in a clause (or the
    "be-er" in a clause that describes existence, nature or state). The 主語 is
    _not_ always explicitly present, it's often implied. (There's always a
    _logical_ subject, but it isn't always explicitly stated.)

  </div> </Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{述語}^(じゅつご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Predicate

    The predicate in a clause describes _what's happening_. It expresses an
    action, existence, or nature/state. The 述語 will _always_ be at least
    partially explicitly stated in _every_ clause.

  </div>
</Definition>

述語 in particular are the most critical part of any Japanese sentence. You can
literally omit everything else, but **every** sentence **always** provides an
explicit 述語 (predicate).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Admonition title="Important">
_Every_ clause **always** has a logical <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (subject) 
and <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (predicate)! The 主語
might be implied, but the 述語 will **always** be explicitly present.
</Admonition>

These two parts form the framework of _every_ clause.

### Subsidiary parts

The remaining sub-parts of a clause fall into one of the following three categories:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{修飾語}^(しゅうしょくご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Modifiers 
    
    Words that modify or qualify other parts of the clause.
    
    - 「**ゆっくり**歩く」("_slowly_ walk")
  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{接続語}^(せつぞくご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Conjunctions 
    
    Words that connect distinct clauses or clause-parts.

    - 「**安いのに**、おいしい」 ("_it's cheap, but_ it's delicious").

  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{独立語}^(どくりつご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Interjections

    Independent words.

    - 「**さあ**、やろう」 ("_hey,_ let's do it")

  </div>
</Definition>

## Parts of speech

The Japanese words for "parts of speech" is {品詞}^(ひんし).

The character 詞 means "a part of speech." It's used to indicate a grammatical
_type_ or _function,_ and doesn't refer to individual words or categories of
words themselves.

The characters 言 or 語 refer to _instances_ or groupings of words, while 詞
indicates parts-of-speech (the _type_ of a group of words) specifically.

Most of us are familiar with the _English_ parts-of-speech called _nouns_ and _verbs._
Unsurprisingly, Japanese has both of these as well, but the Japanese names are:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{名詞}^(めいし)</span>
  <div>
    #### Noun 
    
    Literally: a "named part of speech".
  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{動詞}^(どうし)</span>
  <div>
    #### Verb 
    
    Literally: a "movement/change part of speech".
  </div>
</Definition>

Including these, Japanese has ten total parts of speech, broken into three major
categories.

### The parts-of-speech taxonomy

The following diagram provides an excellent synopsis for the ten parts of
speech. Refer back to it often:

<Figure figId="parts_of_speech_translated" caption="Parts of speech">
  ![Parts of speech diagram](/images/parts-of-speech-translated.png)
</Figure>

<Admonition title="Note">
  Many Japanese grammar resources only refer to _eight_ parts of speech
  (**八**品詞). The diagram above also includes two additional types for
  auxiliary verbs and particles that can't be used by themselves.
</Admonition>

The ten parts of speech are broken into three major categories:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1.  [<ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>](/en/grammar/2-yougen) are
    the most important category. 
    
    Grammarians call these
    "inflectable" or "declinable" words that are used in the predicate. Honestly, the Japanese
    characters are easier to understand: 用言 means "use words" or "utilization
    words". They're used to _do_ things.

2.  [Non-inflectable words, or freestanding words that _aren't_ 用言](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen). 

    The
    most important of these are **<ruby>体言<rp>(</rp><rt>たいげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>**,
    words that can become _subjects_. All 体言 have a type of [名詞 (noun)](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%E3%82%81%E3%81%84%E3%81%97-nouns)

3.  **Auxiliary or attached words-suffixes**

We will describe each of these categories in turn.

### 用言: predicate words

[用言](/en/grammar/2-yougen) are by far the most important part of a sentence. Japanese often omits or implies
everything else, but there will _always_ be at least one 用言 explicitly
provided to tell you what's happening in the sentence.

Note that 用言 are underlined in red in the [parts of speech diagram above](/en/grammar/1-foundations#the-parts-of-speech-taxonomy).

Japanese has _three_ parts of speech in the 用言 category:

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{動詞}^(どうし)](/en/grammar/2-yougen#%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%81%97)</span>
  <div>
    #### Verbs 
    
    The plain or dictionary form of these words will always end with a sound from the う column of the kana charts.

    - {笑う}^(わらう) (to laugh)
    - {行く}^(いく) (to go)

  </div>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{形容詞}^(けいようし)](/en/grammar/2-yougen#%E5%BD%A2%E5%AE%B9%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%91%E3%81%84%E3%82%88%E3%81%86%E3%81%97)</span>
  <div>
    #### Is-verbs
    
      Most English-language resources call these "adjectives" 
      or ”い-adjectives" (because they always end with the kana character い).

      Because Japanese themselves consider 形容詞 a form of _用言,_ however, this
      site strongly prefers to think of them as "is-verbs" or ”い is-verbs".

      They are single words that specify a subject's _state_ or _nature_. In
      other words, they say the subject "_is_ something", but they don't need to
      add another word to do so: the "is" is _part of itself_.

    - {白い}^(しろい) (is-white)
    - {近い}^(ちかい) (is-near)

  </div>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{形容動詞}^(けいようどうし)](/en/grammar/2-yougen#%E5%BD%A2%E5%AE%B9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%91%E3%81%84%E3%82%88%E3%81%86%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%81%97)</span>
  <div>
    #### だ Is-verbs
    
      Similarly, English-language textbooks on Japanese grammar usually call
      these "な-adjectives", or "nominalizing adjectives". This site prefers "だ
      is-verbs" for is-verbs that are formed with the suffix だ.

    - {静かだ}^(しずかだ) (is-quiet)
    - {大変だ}^(たいへんだ) (is-terrible)

  </div>
</Definition>

These three word-types all _function_ like verbs do in English. Technically, only 動詞
is _literally translated_ as "verb", but all three types _function_ like verbs.
They are the part of a predicate that explain _what's happening_.

#### SVO vs. SOV

English tends to focus on the _who_ and _what_ within a sentence, while
Japanese tends to focus on the _action_ or _state._

English is often described as an "SVO" grammar (subject, verb, object in that
order). For example, the sentence: "I eat it" contains the subject "I", then the
verb "eat", and finally the object "it". We tend to focus on the first word of
that sentence: "I".

Japanese is often described as "SOV" because the verb comes at the end. They
tend to focus on the last word of a sentence, the verb.

This site believes Japanese is better considered an "SV" language. It sometimes
even acts like just a "V" language!

In Japanese, "I eat it" (the exact same thought from above) would _normally_ be
expressed as just:

> 「食べる」

This is still a complete sentence, even though it's only a single word!

The subject "I" and object "it" are _implied._ Japanese grammar rules allow
them to be omitted since they aren't necessary for understanding. Explicitly
adding the extra words (私があれを食べる) would sound wordy and weird.

#### Implied words can be omitted

Imagine offering food to a hungry Tarzan. If he replied with an enthusiastic
"Eat!" (or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">「食べる！」</span> in Japanese), would you have any difficulty understanding that he will eat the
food you were offering?

English grammar explicitly requires words that, strictly speaking, aren't
necessary.

The words "I" and "it" would be _unnecessary_ for comprehension. The verb
"eat" communicates all we need to know, but English grammar rules pretty
much _mandate_ that we provide the unnecessary words (else we sound like
Tarzan).

Japanese doesn't work that way! (Which makes one wonder how Tarzan-speech is
represented in Japanese manga.)

Japanese is a _denser_ language. It's more efficient because it allows you to
omit unneccesary pronouns like "I" and "it".

### 体言: subject words

{体言}^(たいげん) literally means "body" or "subject" words.

体言 are "substantive" words that can become the [主語
(subject)](/en/grammar/7-construction#%E4%B8%BB%E8%AA%9E-subjects) of a
sentence. They are "things" rather than actions/existence/nature/state.

Note that 体言 are underlined in red in the [parts of speech diagram](/en/grammar/1-foundations#the-parts-of-speech-taxonomy) above.

There is only one grammatical type for 体言:

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{名詞}^(めいし)](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%E3%82%81%E3%81%84%E3%81%97-nouns)</span>
  <div>
    #### Nouns
    
    This is the only type in this category that can become a subject.

    - {新湯}^(あらゆ) (freshly-poured-hot-bathwater)
    - {森林}^(しんりん) (forest; woods)

  </div>
</Definition>

### Other grammatical types

There are four remaining grammatical types that are neither 用言 nor 体言:

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{副詞}^(ふくし)](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E5%89%AF%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%B5%E3%81%8F%E3%81%97-adverbs)</span>
  <div>
    #### Adverbs
    
    These modify or qualify 用言.

    - {再び}^(ふたたび) (again)
    - とても (very; awfully; exceedingly)

  </div>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{連体詞}^(れんたいし)](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E5%89%AF%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%B5%E3%81%8F%E3%81%97-adverbs)</span>
  <div>
    #### Pre-noun adjectives
    
    These modify or qualify 体言.

    Jargon is hard to avoid with this part of speech. They are closer to the
    English concept of "determiners" or "definite/indefinite articles" like
    "the, "this", or "every". They only modify nouns and can't act like verbs.

    - この (this)
    - あらゆる (every)

  </div>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{接続詞}^(せつぞくし)](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%9B%E3%81%A4%E3%81%9E%E3%81%8F%E3%81%97-conjunctives)</span>
  <div>
    #### Conjunctives
    
    These connect clauses or parts of clauses together.

    - また (and; in addition)
    - しかし (however; but)

  </div>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{感動詞}^(かんどうし)](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E6%84%9F%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%8B%E3%82%93%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%81%97-interjections)</span>
  <div>
    #### Interjections
    
    These express excitement, call for attention, or act as greetings/acknowledgment.

    - さあ (come; here; all right; well; ah; actually)
    - はい (acknowledged; understood)

  </div>
</Definition>

### Word-suffixes

These auxiliary word-suffices aren't standalone words, but things that attach as
suffixes to other words.

There are two types:

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{助動詞}^(じょうどうし)](/en/grammar/3-non-yougen#%E6%84%9F%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%8B%E3%82%93%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%81%97-interjections)</span>
  <div>
    #### Auxiliary verbs
    
    These are suffixes that "inflect" or "conjugate" other verbs to modify the meaning.

    - 〜られる (expresses potential)
    - 〜ない (expresses negation)

  </div>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <span slot="term">[{助詞}^(じょし)](#)</span>
  <div>
    #### Particles
    
    These indicate the function of preceding words or other clause parts.

    - 〜は (topic identifier)
    - 〜へ (direction identifier)

  </div>
</Definition>

## Other word categories

There are three more categories of words that we've not described so far:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{指示語}^(しじご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Pointing words

    These are also known as こそあど language.  There is no good English equivalent
    to describe these because they can function as any of several different
    grammatical types: 名詞 (nouns), 連体詞 (pre-noun adjectives), 副詞 (adverbs), or
    形容動詞 (だ "is-verbs").

    Things close to the speaker use the こ forms: ここ、これ、こちら.

    Things near the listener use the そ forms: そこ、それ、そちら.

    Things far from both the speaker and listener use the あ forms: あそこ、あれ、あ
    ちら.

    Undecided/unsettled things use the ど form: どこ、どれ、どちら.

  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{複合語}^(ふくごうご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Compound words

    These are single words
    formed with two or more other words. They can be nouns, verbs, or い "is-verbs":

    - 複合名詞, e.g. 春＋風 → {春風}^(しゅんぷう) (a spring-breeze)

    - 複合動詞, e.g. 旅＋立つ → {旅立つ}^(たびだつ) (beginning-a-trip)

    - 複合形容詞, e.g. 心＋細い → {心細い}^(こころぼそい) (is-anxious)

    Regardless of form, these are _single_ words in Japanese. They should never
    be broken apart in a diagram. There aren't any separate modifiers: they are
    individual compound-words, not a modifier plus another word.

  </div>
</Definition>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Definition>
  <span slot="term">{派生語}^(はせいご)</span>
  <div>
    #### Derived words

    There are two sub-categories of derived words, prefixed words and suffixed words:

    - {接頭語}^(せっとうご) (prefixed words), e.g. お{米}^(こめ)　とり{調}^(しら)べる　か{弱}^(よわ)い

    - {接尾語}^(せつびご) (suffixed words), e.g. ぼくたち　{春}^(はる)めく　{子供}^(こども)らしい

    Like 複合語, 派生語 can be nouns, verbs, or い "is-verbs". They are also
    individual words that should never be broken apart in a diagram.

  </div>
</Definition>

## Summary

The most important categories of words are 用言 and 体言:

- **用言** literally means "use words". They include _three_ different parts of
  speech: not only 動詞 (verbs), but "is-verbs" like 形容詞 and 形容動詞 as well.

- **体言** literally means "subject words" or "body words". They are _always_ 名 詞
  (nouns) or things that have been "nominalized" to act like nouns.

**Every** clause has a 主語 (subject) and a 述語 (predicate).

**品詞** are parts of speech. They are grammatical types rather than individual
word instances or groupings/categories of words. There are eight "freestanding"
parts of speech (we will describe rules for diagramming each elsewhere on this
site).

Things like compound words and derived words should _not_ be broken apart in a
sentence diagram. They should be considered as individual units.
