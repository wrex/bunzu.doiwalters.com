## Units of composition

These are the basic units or divisions of Japanese writing, from largest to smallest:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>文章<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんしょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> Means writing in general (an article, composition, essay, or, an individual _sentence_.)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>段落<rp>(</rp><rt>だんらく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> A paragraph. Literally, "falling rows" of text.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>文<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> A sentence (that can be delimited with a period.)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> An individual clause or phrase within a sentence.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>単語<rp>(</rp><rt>たんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> An individual word.

We are only concerned with 文, 文節, and 単語 (sentences, clauses/phrases, and
words). In particular, identifying the "core" 文節 in a sentence is the most
critical part of diagramming.

One caution: while the term 文章 is often translated as the English word "sentence",
the word 文 more accurately reflects the English concept of a sentence
(something that ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation point).

## 文節 (clause) sub-parts

### Subjects and predicates

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (clauses) are _by far_ the most
important grammatical constructs when diagramming.

Every fully-formed 文 (sentence) contains at least one 文節 (clause). Many _only_
have one, but complex sentences might have many.

Every 文節 contains two parts:

- **<ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>** (subject)

- **<ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>** (predicate)

述語 in particular are the most critical part of any Japanese sentence. You can
literally omit everything else, but **every** sentence **always** provides an
explicit 述語 (predicate).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Admonition title="Important">
_Every_ clause **always** has a logical <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (subject) 
and <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (predicate)! The 主語
might be implied, but the 述語 will **always** be explicitly present.
</Admonition>

These two parts form the framework of _every_ clause. We discuss them in more
detail below.

### Other parts

The remaining words in a clause fall into one of the following categories:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- **<ruby>修飾語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅうしょくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>** (modifiers, words that modify or qualify other parts of the clause)

  For example, the word よっくり in 「ゆっくり歩く」("_slowly_ walk") is a type
  of 修飾語.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- **<ruby>接続語<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (connectors, words that connect distinct clauses)

  For example, 安いのに in the clause 「安いのに、おいしい」("_it's cheap, but_
  it's delicious").

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- **<ruby>独立語<rp>(</rp><rt>どくりつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (independent words, interjections)

  For example, さあ in the clause 「さあ、やろう」 ("_hey,_ let's do it").

## Parts of speech

{/* prettier-ignore */}
If 文節 are the "molecules" of Japanese, then <strong><ruby>品詞<rp>(</rp><rt>ひんし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (parts of speech) are the atoms.

That's not a perfect analogy, though. The character 詞 means "a part of speech."
It's used to indicate a grammatical _type_ or _function,_ and doesn't refer to
individual words themselves. The characters 言 or 語 refer to groupings or
_instances_ of words, while 詞 indicates parts-of-speech (the _type_ of a group
of words) specifically.

Most of us are familiar with the _English_ parts-of-speech called _nouns_ and _verbs._
Unsurprisingly, Japanese has both of these as well, but the Japanese names are:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> "noun" (literally, "named part of speech")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> "verb" (literally,
  "movement/change part of speech")

Including these, Japanese has ten total parts of speech, broken into three major
categories.

### The parts-of-speech taxonomy

<Figure caption="Parts of speech">
  ![Parts of speech diagram](/images/parts-of-speech-translated.png)
</Figure>

<Admonition title="Note">
  Many Japanese grammar resources only refer to **八**品詞, or _eight_ parts of
  speech. The diagram above also includes two additional types for auxiliary
  word-suffixes that can't be used by themselves.
</Admonition>

The ten parts of speech are broken into three major categories:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1.  <strong><ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> are
    the most important category. Grammarians call these
    "inflectable" or "declinable" words that are used in the predicate. Honestly, the Japanese
    characters are easier to understand: 用言 means "use words" or "utilization
    words". They're used to _do_ things.

2.  **Non-inflectable words**, or freestanding words that _aren't_ 用言.

3.  **Auxiliary or attached words-suffixes**

We will describe each of these categories in turn.

### 用言: predicate words

用言 are by far the most important part of a sentence. Japanese often omits or implies
everything else, but there will _always_ be at least one 用言 explicitly
provided to tell you what's happening in the sentence.

Japanese has _three_ parts of speech in the 用言 category:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (verbs)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong>
      (so-called "い-adjectives", or just "adjectives")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <strong><ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> 
      (so-called "な-adjectives", or "nominalizing adjectives")

Dictionaries call 用言 called "inflectable" or "declinable" words. For non-grammarians,
it's easier to understand what 用言 actually _do_.

These three word-types all _function_ like verbs (though technically, only 動詞
are _actually_ verbs). They are the part of a predicate that explain _what's happening_.

English tends to focus on the _who_ and _what_ within a sentence, while
Japanese tends to focus on the _action_ or _state._

#### SVO vs. SOV

English is often described as an "SVO" grammar (subject, verb, object in that
order). For example, the sentence: "I eat it" contains the subject "I", then the
verb "eat", and finally the object "it". We tend to focus on the first word of
that sentence: "I".

Japanese is often described as "SOV" because the verb comes at the end. They
tend to focus on the last word of a sentence, the verb.

This site believes Japanese is better considered an "SV" language. It sometimes appears
to be only a "V" language!

In Japanese, "I eat it" (the exact same thought from above) would normally be
expressed as just:

> 「食べる」

This is still a complete sentence, even though it's only a single word!

The subject "I" and object "it" are _implied._ Japanese grammar rules allow
them to be omitted since they aren't necessary for understanding.

#### Implied words can be omitted

Imagine offering food to a hungry Tarzan. If he replied with an enthusiastic
"Eat!" (or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">「食べる！」</span> in Japanese), would you have any difficulty understanding that he will eat the
food you were offering?

English grammar explicitly requires words that, strictly speaking, aren't
necessary.

The words "I" and "it" would be _unnecessary_ for comprehension. The verb
"eat" communicates all we need to know, but English grammar rules pretty
much _mandate_ that we provide the unnecessary words (else we sound like
Tarzan).

Japanese doesn't work that way! (Which makes one wonder how Tarzan-speech is
represented in Japanese manga.)

Japanese is a _denser_ language. It's more efficient because it allows you to
omit unneccesary pronouns like "I" and "it".

### 体言 and other "freestanding" types

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>体言<rp>(</rp><rt>たいげん </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> literally means "subject/body" words.

体言 are "substantive" words that can become the 主語 (subject) of a sentence.

体言 always have a grammatical type of 名詞 (nouns) and are the next most important
category of words after 用言.

In addition to 体言, there are also four more word types that _can't_ become a subject:

1. 用言 modifers/qualifiers: <strong><ruby>副詞<rp>(</rp><rt>ふくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (adverbs)

2. 体言 modifiers/qualifiers: <strong><ruby>連体詞<rp>(</rp><rt>れんたいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> ("definite articles")

3. Clause joiners: <strong><ruby>接続詞<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> ("conjunctives")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
4. <strong><ruby>感動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>かんどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (interjections).

### Word-suffixes

These auxiliary word-suffices aren't standalone words, but things that attach as
suffixes to other words.

There are two types:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1. <strong><ruby>助動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (auxiliary verbs)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
2. <strong><ruby>助詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong>
(particles)

## 指示語 (pointing words)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>指示語<rp>(</rp><rt>しじご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> or "pointing" words are
also known as こそあど language (e.g.: これ、それ、あれ、どれ).

There is no good equivalent English word to describe these because they can
function as several different grammatical types: 名詞 (nouns), 連体詞 (definite articles),
副詞 (adverbs), or 形容動詞 (な "is-verbs").

Things close to the speaker use the こ forms: ここ、これ、こちら.

Things near the listener use the そ forms: そこ、それ、そちら.

Things far from both the speaker and listener use the あ forms: あそこ、あれ、あ
ちら.

Undecided/unsettled things use the ど form: どこ、どれ、どちら.

## 複合語 (compound words)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>複合語<rp>(</rp><rt>ふくごうご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are single words
formed with two or more other words. They can be nouns, verbs, or い "is-verbs":

- 複合名詞, e.g. 春＋風 → 春風 (a spring breeze)

- 複合動詞, e.g. 旅＋立つ → 旅立つ (beginning a trip)

- 複合形容詞, e.g. 心＋細い → 心細い (is-anxious)

Regardless of form, these are single words. They should never be broken apart in
a diagram. There is no modifying going on, they are individual compound-words,
not a modifier plus another word.

## 派生語 (derived words)

There are two categories of derived words, prefixed words and suffixed words:

- 接頭語, e.g. お米　とり調べる　か弱い

- 接尾語, e.g. ぼくたち　春めく　子供らしい

Like 複合語, 派生語 can be nouns, verbs, or い "is-verbs". They are also
individual words that should never be broken apart in a diagram.

## Summary

The most important parts-of-speech categories are 用言 and 体言:

- **体言** literally means "object words" or "body words". They are _always_ 名詞 or
  things that have been "nominalized" to act like nouns.

- **用言** literally means "use words". They includes _three_ different parts of
  speech, not only 動詞 (verbs), but 形容詞 and 形容動詞 as well.

<Admonition title="Important">
**体言** form the <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(subject) of a sentence. They are the "doers".

**用言** form the <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(predicate). They inform "what is being done".

</Admonition>

All of these parts of speech will be explained in more detail on subsequent
pages.
