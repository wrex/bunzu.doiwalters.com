    #### "Use" words

    Words that describe what's going on with the grammatical subject (the
    "doer") in a sentence. These words form the _predicate_ and describe the
    action, existence, nature, or state of the subject (what the subject is
    _doing_). The character 用 means how something is used or serviced.

  </div>
</Definition>

{用言}^(ようげん) are by far the most important part of Japanese grammar.
Literally everything else might be omitted in a sentence, but Japanese clauses
_always_ include an explicit 述語 (predicate) containing at least one 用言.

There are three types of 用言: {動詞}^(どうし), {形容詞}^(けいようし), and
{形容動詞}^(けいようどうし). We will explore each in turn.

## {動詞}^(どうし) (verbs)

### Nature/character

動詞 have three identifying characteristics:

1. They _conjugate_ or _inflect_.

   Examples: [読む](/en/basics#yomu)・読まない・読みます・読めば・...

2. They are freestanding words that can form a 述語 (predicate).

   Examples: [本を **{読む}^(述語)**](/en/basics#honwoyomu).

3. They end with kana from the う column in the 50-音 kana table.

   Examples: 思う・聞く・話す・立つ.

### Grammatical function

動詞 can have four different functions within a sentence:

1. They can form the {述語}^(じゅつご) (predicate):

   Example:

   - [花が **{咲いた}^(述語)**](/en/basics#hanagasaita)

2. They can become {修飾語}^(しゅうしょくご) (modifiers):

   Examples:

   - [**{歩く}^(修飾語)** 習慣を身につける](/en/basics#arukushuukann)

     Translation: "[I] acquire [the] **walking** habit"

   - [早く **{起きるように}^(修飾語)** 努力する](/en/basics#hayakuokiru)

     Translation: "[I] earlier waking endeavor"

     Transliteration: "To earlier-<strong>wake</strong>-endeavor"

3. They can become the {主語}^(しゅご) (subject) by using particles like 「の
   が・のは・のも」:

   Example:

   - 遠くに **{見えるのが}^(主語)** 富士山だ

     Translation: "You can see Mount Fuji in the distance"

     Transliteration: "**Seen-thing** in the distance is-Mount-Fuji"

4. They can become {接続語}^(せつぞくご) (conjunctions) connecting clauses.

   Example:

   - いくら **{待っても}^(接続語)** 来ない

     Translation: "[He/she/it] won't come no matter how long you wait"

     Transliteration "[you] indeterminate-**wait-even**, [he/she/it] won't come"

# TODO EVERYTHING PAST THIS POINT

Japanese is a predicate-centric language. The words at the end of a clause tend
to be the most important because that's where the predicate normally resides.

As shown at the top of the [parts-of-speech
diagram](/en/grammar/1-foundations#fig_parts-of-speech), there are three parts
of speech that can be "inflected." These are standalone words that can become
predicates all on their own (in Japanese: {単独}^(たんどく)で{述語}^(じゅつご)となるもの).

<Admonition title="Important">
  Remember: There are _three_ types of 用言. All three can become a predicate on
  their own, without any other words or modifiers.
</Admonition>

### 動詞 (verbs)

There are only three types of 動詞 in Japanese:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>一段<rp>(</rp><rt>いちだん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>動詞: These
  [congugate](/en/yougen#conjugating-%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%80) while
  keeping the final "vowel" in the _same_ 段 (column) of the 50-音 (50-sound)
  chart and _adding_ a suffix: 食べる・食べない・食べます・食べれます・食べよう

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>五段<rp>(</rp><rt>ごだん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>動詞: These 
  [conjugate](/en/yougen#conjugating-%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%80) by _replacing_
  the final "vowel" with sounds from five different columns:
  行かない・行きます・行く・行けます・行こう

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>変格<rp>(</rp><rt>へんかく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>動詞: These 
  are the _only_ two special cases: する and 来る which conjugate weirdly.

Please refer to this excellent [article about verb conjugation on
Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conjugation-groups/) for
more details about how to conjugate/inflect verbs of each type.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong>

形容詞 (so-called "い-adjectives") indicate nature or _state_ and end with the kana character い.

形容詞 _always_ end with い.

Examples:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>近<rp>(</rp><rt>ちか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-near).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
### <strong><ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong>

形容動詞 (so-called "な-adjectives") indicate nature or state and end with the literal kana character だ.

The "stem form" of 形容動詞 can end with any kana character.

In particular, note that some 形容動詞 have a stem that ends with い. This can make it
difficult for learners to remember which is which.

For example, the word きれい (pretty) is 形容動詞, _not_ 形容詞 despite ending with
い. It's the _stem_ of きれいだ (is-pretty). There is no rule or trick to
recognizing these, just rote memorization.

Examples:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ (is-quiet)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby> 大変<rp>(</rp> <rt>たいへん</rt> <rp>)</rp> </ruby> だ (is-serious, is-grave)

## "is-verbs" not "adjectives"

Note the form of the English translations for the 形容詞 and 形容動詞 examples. They
include, for example, "is-white" and "is-quiet", not just "white" and "quiet".

This idea may be contentious for some, but the author believes strongly that
_Japanese grammarians consider 形容詞 and 形容動詞 more like "is-verbs" than
adjectives!_

To an English speaker, "is-white" and "is-quiet" aren't words, but it's clear
that they _mean_ the same thing as the _two_-word expressions "is white" and "is
quiet". Thinking of them as hyphenated "is-verbs" like this makes it clear that
these are single, "freestanding" words. It helps us to think like Japanese
natives.

Remember: with Japanese grammar, the two "first class" categories of words are 用言
(predicate words) and 体言 (subject/object) words. These roughly correlate to
verbs and nouns in English.

To a Japanese native, 白い and 静かだ (with the い and だ included) are 用言.
They are _standalone_ words that _can form a predicate all on their own._ They are
primarily verb-like.

They _aren't_ second-class words that merely _modify_ or _qualify_ 体言. They are
_first-class_ parts of speech that form _predicates_.

In contrast, the English word "white," for example, is either an adjective or a noun. It isn't
"verb-like" at all. To use it in a predicate, we _must_ add another word like
"is": "◯ is white".

But _形容詞 and 形容動詞 act as predicates all on their own._ That's why
thinking of them as compound words ("is-white", for example) is advantageous.

Japanese natives think of these word-types as primarily 用言, and only incidentally as
"adjective-like". You should, too.

The author feels this flip-flopped style of instruction (thinking of them
"adjectives" rather than "is-verbs") causes confusion and leads
to students uttering "eihongo"[^1] sentences like 「東京は近い**だ**」&mdash;
that extra だ is grammatically wrong and _exactly_ equivalent to saying "Tokyo
**is** is near" (with an extra "is").

[^1]:
    Either Cure Dolly or Proffessor Rubin likely coined the word "Eihongo" as
    the inverse of "Japlish". It means funny-sounding Japanese that immediately
    exposes a non-native speaker.

Thinking of 形容詞 words as meaning "is-◯" helps English speakers remember
that they are verb-like words that can stand on their own in a predicate _as
well as_ describe nouns.

<Admonition title="Warning">

There is however, one irritating point of confusion.

For the most part, だ and です are pretty much interchangeable. The latter
is basically a more polite form of the former.

But it's _always_ wrong to append だ to the end of a sentence that uses a 形容詞
as the predicate:

- 犬が白い (grammatically correct, meaning "the dog is-white")

- ~~犬が白い**だ**~~ (_incorrect_ grammar!)

Confusingly, though, appending です instead of だ, _is_ grammaticallly correct:

- 犬が白いです (grammatically correct, politer, but still meaning "the dog is-white")

This really is a special case. Adding です after 形容詞 at the end of a sentence
makes it more polite, but it is grammatically weird. It comes about because
there are no "polite forms" of 形容詞 -- you must add _something_ to make the
sentence politer and the since です usually feels polite, that's how it's used.

Like all human languages, Japanese grammar occasionally has weird inconsistencies like this.

</Admonition>

## There is no い particle

The final い in 形容詞 is _part of the word_, not an "い particle"! There is no such
thing as an い particle.

You aren't turning a word into a 形容詞 by adding い, the 形容詞 _already has い as part
of the word_.

The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (white) is 名詞, a
_noun_. You you might use it in a chess match, for example, to say things
like 「白が<ruby>勝<rp>(</rp><rt>か</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>った」("white won").

The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white) is 形容詞,
_and is an entirely different word_ than 白.

This is another reason the author believes it better to think of 白い as
"is-white" rather than just "white". It helps to reenforce the idea that it's a
separate word on its own. Obviously they are _related_, but they are
different words with different grammatical types. They _aren't_ the same word
with い appended.

<Admonition title="Warning">

One more technicality.

Unlike 形容詞, dictionary entries for 形容動詞 _won't_ usually include the だ. The
dictionary will have an entry for 静か but probably not for 静かだ.

Technically, **だ and な appended to 形容動詞 _are_ 助詞 (particles),** but い
appended to a 形容詞 is not.

形容詞 _always_ include い whether ending a sentence or modifying something else, so
the dictionary entries _include_ the い as part of the word. The い is _not_ a particle.

形容動詞 use **だ** for their primary purpose (when they are used as 用言 at the end of a
sentence), but **な** for their alternate usage (to modify nouns). So both _are_
considered particles.

There are two ways だ can be used at the end of a sentence:

- As _part of_ a 形容動詞 (as described above)

- After a 名詞 or something acting like a noun. In this case だ is actually an
  助動詞, an _auxiliary-verb_ or particle-verb, meaning "is".

It's best to "think of" だ as part of a 形容動詞 at the end of a sentence. It's
_not_ a separate "verb" like "is".

Grammatical Japanese sentences don't normally use the "stem" of a 形容動詞 on their
own _without_ だ or な. Someone exclaiming「静か」would be understood, but it
sounds unfinished. Do they mean "it is quiet" or "that's a quiet thing"?

Western grammarians tend to think of 形容動詞 as "nominalizing" adjectives. They
think of the stem form as a special sort of noun, and think of だ as a
verb. While this way of thinking mostly "works" it simply isn't how
it's taught in Japan. In Japanese dictionaries, だ is a particle.

</Admonition>

Because Japanese grammar considers an explicit subject optional,

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>行<rp>(</rp><rt>い </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>寒<rp>(</rp><rt>さむ </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ

(a 動詞, 形容詞, and 形容動詞 respectively) are **complete** sentences!

## Conjugating 用言

Changing the suffix of 用言 modifies the meaning in various ways. These are called
"conjugations" or maybe "inflections" (ask a linguist).

Syntactically, they remain 用言. These conjugations/inflections don't change how
we diagram a sentence. They do change the semantic _meaning_ however, so they
are worth learning.

Note that all _three_ types of 用言 can be modified in this way, not just 動詞.

Examples of modifying the plain or dictionary form of 用言:

- Changing tense:

      - 食・べる → 食・べた ("eat" → "ate")

      - 美味し・い → 美味し・かった ("is-delicious" → "was-delicious")

      - きれい・だ → きれい・だった ("is-pretty" → "was-pretty")

      - _etc._

- Negating meanings:

      - 食・べる → 食・べない ("eat" → "not eat")

      - 美味し・い → 美味し・くない ("delicious" → "not delicious")

      - きれい・だ → きれい・じゃない ("pretty" → "not pretty")

- Changing to passive voice:

      - 食・べる → 食・べられた ("to eat" → "to have eaten")

      The concept of voice only applies to true 動詞 (they can be active or
      passive). It doesn't apply to 形容詞 and 形容動詞 because they are about nature
      or state -- there _is_ no action, passive or otherwise.

There are many more ways to inflect 用言 than these. Please refer to the
[suggested grammar resources](/en/grammar-intro#grammar-resources) for more
exhaustive investigations.
