Japanese grammar is a very deep and difficult subject, and the author is _not_
an expert. What we cover here is only the tip of the iceberg (it's mostly the
high-level stuff necessary to understand sentence diagrams).

Very little grammar is required to _understand_ sentence diagrams. Sentence
diagrams don't use grammar terms _at all_ (in either language).

Unfortunately, one does need to use and understand grammar terms in order to
_create_ sentence diagrams. This section explains the terminology used in the
section for creating diagrams.

## Online resources

For a more thorough introduction to Japanese grammar, the author highly
recommends the following free sites:

### Written in English

- [The Tofugu grammar hub](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/)

- [Cure Dolly's videos and
  book](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ)

  Warning: The book may be easier more comfortable for most people. The animated
  "android" and creepy voice can be a bit hard to take at first, but the content
  is well worth it. Much of this site reflects ideas from these videos. One
  strong recommendation: turn on subtitles and watch at 1.25X speed (with or
  without audio).

  Sadly, the author of these wonderful videos is no longer with us. I'm unsure
  of her background, but based on her slightly odd diction in _both_ languages, I
  suspect she was a native Japanese speaker who moved to an English speaking
  country as a child, and spent the majority of her life in the west.

- Jay Rubin's book _Making sense of Japanese_ is an outstanding resource. It
  does exactly what it promises, and many of the ideas underly both the Cure
  Dolly videos and this site. It's not structured as a textbook, but rather as
  more conversational prose. It introduces some of the most important aspects
  of the language (things that English-speakers tend to misunderstand).

### Written in Japanese

Most of this section is the author's attempt at translating material from a
wonderful online Japanese grammar tutorial aimed at Japanese middle-school students: [国語の文
法](https://www.kokugobunpou.com/#gsc.tab=0).

We only present a drastically reduced subset of the material available on the
original site, however. Please refer to the original for further explanation.

Again, the goal is to explain Japanese grammar _as it is taught to Japanese
natives_, using Japanese terminology as much as possible. Further, we only teach
enough grammar to enable one to create Japanese sentence diagrams.

Any errors on the remainder of this site are almost certainly due to the author's poor
Japanese reading skills and misunderstanding of the concepts.
