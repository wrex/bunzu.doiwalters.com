Now lets move up from thinking about individual words to discussing grammatical
_combinations_ of words.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (clauses) are the most
important grammatical structure when diagramming.

Every fully-formed 文 (sentence) contains at least one 文節 (clause). Many _only_
have one, but complex sentences might have many.

Every 文節 contains two parts: a <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(subject) and a <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (predicate).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Admonition title="Important">
_Every_ clause **always** has a logical <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (subject) and <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (predicate)!
</Admonition>

These two parts form the framework of _every_ clause.

## 主語 (subjects)

The 主語 answers _who_ or _what_. The character 主 ("master") provides a clue: The
主語 is the "master" of the clause: it's performs an action, or simply _exists_
in some state of being.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
The 主語 is usually identified by the <ruby>助詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (particle)
「が」that immediately follows.

One point of confusion for foreign learners: The 主語 is often
_omitted_ in speech or writing. It's often _implied_ from prior context, or
something outside of the sentence itself.

Imagine, for example, that someone pointed at a flower and uttered the single word sentence:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
> <ruby>咲<rp>(</rp><rt>さ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いている

That is a complete, grammatical, single-clause Japanese sentence that means "blooming".

The intended subject of that sentence is obviously _flower_. They are pointing out that _the
flower_ is blooming.

But that's the _semantic_ (logical) 主語 &mdash; there _is no_ syntactical
(literal) 主語 anywhere in the sentence. It's a complete, and perfectly
grammatical, Japanese sentence nonetheless.

<Admonition title="Important">
  主語 are often omitted in writing or speech, but _something_ **always** acts
  as the logical "master" in **every** clause, even if isn't explicitly
  mentioned.
</Admonition>

Since sentence diagrams are all about _syntax,_ this last rule presents a bit of quandary.

If every clause has a subject, and we wish to diagram complete clauses, what do
we display when a clause uses an implied _logical_ 主語, and no _literal_ subject
actually appears? How do we show that the logical subject comes from somewhere
outside of the sentence itself?

### Subjectless clauses

If asked to translate the sentence「咲いている」into English, we'd write "**It's**
blooming".

English grammar _requires_ an explicit subject to form a grammatical
clause, so we (somewhat unconsciously) add the word "it".

Whether we realize it or not, we've trained our brains to _always_ include at
least a pronoun so that there is a subject in _every_ English clause.

But there is no Japanese word for "it" explicitly present in the original
sentence! We've completely imagined an explicit subject ("it") out of thin air
and added it to our translation.

English grammar rules _mandate_ an explicit subject ("it"), but Japanese grammar
rules simply don't.

The word "it" doesn't even add any information to the sentence! It
just informs us of something we already knew: _something_ is acting as the
subject.

To completely beat the point into the ground: We _could_ effectively and
completely communicate the idea that a flower is blooming even in English by
pointing to it and just saying the single word "blooming".

We might even _think_ that in our heads. Unfortunately, actually _saying_ a
solitary word like that sounds like a crazy person talking to themselves. We
_automatically_ say, "**it's** blooming" when talking to someone else.

A Japanese person would simply say「咲いている」. They don't need to prefix it with
something like「あれが」because _Japanese grammar automatically **implies** a pronoun
when the subject is omitted._

<Admonition title="Important">
  Japanese grammar automatically **implies** a pronoun if the subject is
  omitted.
</Admonition>

Using proper grammar in either language makes us seem less crazy to others when
communicating!

### The zero pronoun

But what pronoun do we use when the subject isn't given explicitly? Should we
use "I", "he", "she", "it", or what?

Ideally, we'd like to use the same exact diagram for the sentence「咲いている」no
matter the context we find it in. We'd like to use the same diagram whether someone is
pointing to a flower ("it's blooming") or if it's a weird science fiction novel
with someone pointing to their neighbor ("he's blooming").

Many foreign learners (the author in particulary) find it easier to imagine a
magical "zero pronoun" acting as the syntactic 主語 when it is omitted. It's a
"zero" pronoun because it's not spoken out loud, nor does it ever appear in
"real" writing (though we _will_ show it in diagrams!).

The zero pronoun acts like any other pronoun (e.g. he, she, they, it, etc.): it
stands in for something else. It's a _magic_ pronoun, though, because it
can act like _any_ other pronoun, standing in for literally anything.

If the context is a flower, it means "it". If the context is the author, it
means "I". If the context is the author's neighbor, it means "he".

The zero pronoun is an important but admittedly nebulous _semantic_ concept. In
order to make it obvious that Japanese clauses always have a subject,
we will make the zero pronoun visible and explicit in our diagrams.

Japanese sentence diagrams use the symbol ◯ to represent the zero pronoun. [To
make it easier to type, the symbol &ldquo;@&rdquo; is also acceptable.]

When we hear or read a sentence like 「咲いている」, it's quite helpful for
English speakers to _imagine_ that the sentence read:

> [ ◯ が ]　咲いている

The stuff in brackets is only imaginary. It isn't normally pronounced when the
sentence is read aloud, because it _isn't actually in the original sentence._
It only ever appears in sentence _diagrams_ and in examples like this one.

Occasionally, though, we'll want to talk _about_ an example like this, or about a
sentence _diagram_ rather than the sentence itself. In that case, the author has
taken to saying「まる」(as in an empty circle: ◯) instead of "zero pronoun".

If forced to read the above example out loud, for example, he'd say
「まるが　さいている」(perhaps putting "air quotes" around the 「まるが」).

<Admonition title="Important">
  _Japanese clauses do not require an explicit 主語_. The subject can be
  _implied_. When it's left out, imagine the "zero pronoun" in its place.
</Admonition>

## 述語 (predicates)

The 述語 specifies _what is done,_ or _how, in what way_, it's done. It comes
at the end of the clause.

<Admonition title="Important">
  述語 are **always** at the very end of a clause.
</Admonition>

Examples:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>鳥<rp>(</rp><rt>とり</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>が<ruby>鳴<rp>(</rp><rt>な</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く ("the bird chirps")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>部屋<rp>(</rp><rt>へや</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>が<ruby>寒<rp>(</rp><rt>さむ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い ("the room is-cold")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>鳥<rp>(</rp><rt>とり</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>が<ruby>静か<rp>(</rp><rt>しずか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>だ ("the bird is-quiet")

The 述語 in these sentences are 鳴く, 寒い, and 静かだ, respectively. They are
all different types of 用言.

### "Missing" 述語

Japanese allows us to omit the _subject_ of a sentence (using the [zero
pronoun](http://localhost:3000/en/bunsetsu#the-zero-pronoun)).

Some sentences sometimes _seem_ to omit the _predicate,_ but this is **never**
the case.

_Every_ sentence has both a subject and a predicate. In particular, _every_
Japanese sentence **must** have a predicate!

Sometimes, though, a sentence only provides a single 名詞 or a single "adjective"
(形容詞 or 形容動詞). Obviously, _something_ must be implied in this case.

The rule is simple: if necessary, append the
[助動詞](http://localhost:3000/en/taigen#%E5%8A%A9%E5%8B%95%E8%A9%9E%E3%81%98%E3%82%87%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%81%97-auxiliary-verbs)　だ
to whatever was provided. That is, assume だ was implied but not explicitly
stated.

Linguists call the auxiliary verb だ a _copula_. It couples two things. It says
those two things are equal or belong together somehow.

Say, for example, someone asked what type of animal goes "moo". The one word
reply is, of course:「牛」(うし, a cow).

That is a grammatically complete and correct sentence, believe it or not. It
means 「[◯ が]　牛 [だ]」(["it" is] a cow).

The noun 牛 is converted to a 用言 by the 助動詞　「だ」.

This works with 形容動詞, too. Normally, a speaker would include the だ (as
discussed [previously]()).

If someone suddenly said, 「静か」 , the
logically correct translation would be "**it's** quiet" if the context implied
they were talking about the room, and "she's quiet" if they were talking about
their wife. Either way, the correct translation would be 「[◯ が]　静か　[だ]」(@
is quiet).

If the only word provided is 形容詞, then t

## Other 文節 components

In addition to the 主語 and 述語, there are three other functional components
that can appear in 文節:

### 修飾語

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>修飾語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅうしょくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _modifiers_ or qualifiers affecting something else.

For example, in the (subjectless) clause:

> ゆっくり 歩く ("Walk slowly")

{/* prettier-ignore */}
the word ゆっくり (slowly) is 修飾語 modifying <ruby>歩<rp>(</rp><rt>ある</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く (to walk, the 述語).

### 接続語

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>接続語<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _conjunctives_ that connect clauses.

For example:

> 安い**のに**、おいしい ("Even though it's cheap, it's delicious")

Here, のに ("even though") is 接続語 (a connective or conjunctive) between two
different (single word) clauses.

Note that in this example _both_ clauses omitted the subject. It's actually the
same _implied_ subject in both clauses (logically: whatever food they are talking about).

### 独立語

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ruby>独立語<rp>(</rp><rt>どくりつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _independent, 
standalone_ words (interjections and exclamations).

The serve almost no functional/structural purpose. We can mostly ignore them
when it comes to diagramming.

Example:

> さあ、やろう ("C'mon, Let's do it")

The word さあ ("C'mon", "well", "Allright") is 独立語 a standalone word. The
real clause (again subject-less) is やろう ("Let's do it").
