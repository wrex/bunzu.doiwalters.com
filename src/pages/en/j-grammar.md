Japanese grammar is a very deep and difficult subject. What we cover here is
only the tip of the iceberg (it's just the high-level stuff necessary to
understand sentence diagrams).

For a more thorough introduction to Japanese grammar, the author highly recommends:

- The [Tofugu grammar hub](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/)

- [Cure Dolly's videos and
  book](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ)

  Warning: The book may be easier more comfortable for most people. The animated
  "android" and creepy voice can be a bit hard to take at first, but the content
  is well worth it. Much of this site reflects ideas from these videos. One
  strong recommendation: turn on subtitles and watch at 1.25X speed (with or
  without audio).

  Sadly, the author of these wonderful videos is no longer with us. I'm unsure
  of her background, but based on her slightly odd diction in _both_ languages, I
  suspect she was a native Japanese speaker who moved to an English speaking
  country as a child, and spent the majority of her life in the west.

- Jay Rubin's book _Making sense of Japanese_ is an outstanding resource. It
  does exactly what it promises, and many of the ideas underly both the Cure
  Dolly videos and this site. It's not structured as a textbook, but rather as
  more conversational prose. It introduces some of the most important aspects
  of the language (things that English-speakers tend to misunderstand).

## Units of composition

Japanese schoolteachers would teach these basic units or divisions of Japanese
writing, from largest to smallest:

- <ruby>文章<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんしょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> Means writing in
  general (an article, composition, essay, or, an individual _sentence_.)

- <ruby>段落<rp>(</rp><rt>だんらく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> A paragraph. Literally, "falling
  rows" of text.

- <ruby>文<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> A sentence (that can be
  demarcated by a period.)

- <ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> An individual clause or phrase
  within a sentence.

- <ruby>単語<rp>(</rp><rt>たんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> An individual word.

We are only concerned with 文, 文節, and 単語 (sentences, clauses/phrase, and
words). In particular, identifying 文節 is the most critical part of diagramming.

## Parts of speech

If 文章 are the "molecules" of Japanese, then
<ruby>品詞<rp>(</rp><rt>ひんし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (parts of speech) are the atoms.

That's not a very good analogy, though. The character 詞 means "a part of
speech." It's used to indicate a grammatical _type_ or _function,_ not
individual instances of words.

The characters 言 or 語 generally indicate words, sayings, or
collections of words or speech, but 詞 is reserved for _types_ of words (in
English: "parts of speech").

Japanese has ten types broken into different three major categories. Here is the taxonomy:

![Parts of speech diagram](/images/parts-of-speech-translated.png)

### The main categories

Most Japanese grammar resources refer to 八品詞, the "_eight_ parts of speech".

While there are only eight primary, or "freestanding" parts of speech, the
diagram above also includes two additional auxiliary or attached types
(auxiliary-verbs and particles).

The ten parts of speech are divided into the following three categories:

1.  <ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> or "inflectable"
    words.

    That's enough linguistic-grammarian. These words _function_ like verbs.
    They are the part of a predicate that explain _what's happening_.

    English tends to focus on the _who_ and _what_ within a sentence, while
    Japanese tends to focus on the _action_ or _state._

    English is often described as an "SVO" grammar (subject, verb, object in that
    order): "I eat it".

    Japanese is often described at "SOV" because the verb comes at the end. But
    it's perhaps better considered a "SV" language, or even just a "V" language! In
    Japanese, the exact same thought ("I eat it") might be expressed as

    > 「食べる」

    This is still a complete sentence, even though it's only a single word! The
    subject "I" and object "food" are implied, and Japanese grammar rules allow
    them to be omitted if they aren't necessary.

    Think about it: If you offered food to a hungry Tarzan, and he replied with
    an enthusiastic "Eat!", would you have any difficulty understanding that he
    will eat the food you were offering? The words "I" and "it" are
    unnecessary for comprehension, but English grammar rules pretty much
    _mandate_ that we provide them (else we sound like Tarzan). Japanese doesn't
    work that way! (Which makes me wonder how Tarzan speaks in Japanese manga.)

    用言 are the most important parts of a Japanese sentence. They come at the
    _end_ of sentences. It's not much of an overstatement to say that Japanese is
    mostly read _backwards_.

    There are _three_ types of 用言 (described in another section below).

2.  "Non-inflectable" words, or things that _aren't_ 用言.

    This consists primarily of "substantive" words (名詞 or nouns in English) that can
    become the 主語 (subject) of a sentence. Things that can act as 名詞 are also
    known as <ruby>体言<rp>(</rp><rt>たいげん </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

    This category also includes four more word types that _can't_ become a
    subject, however. These basically comprise the the "other" sub-category
    (they are secondary types and not as important to understanding as as 用言 and
    体言).

3.  Auxiliary or attached "words," or more accurately "word parts".

    These aren't standalone words, but things that attach as suffixes to other
    words.

The most important parts-of-speech categories are 用言 and 体言:

- 体言 are 名詞 (nouns) or things that have been "nominalized" to act like
  nouns. They can become the <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご
  </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (subject) of a sentence.

- 用言, however, are 動詞, 形容詞, _or_ 形容動詞! They become the <ruby>述語
  <rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (predicate) of a sentence.

### <ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> predicate words

Japanese is a predicate-centric language. The words at the end of a clause
(the predicate) tend to be the most important.

As shown at the top of the diagram, there are three types of "inflectable,"
standalone words that can become predicates all on their own (単独で述語となるもの).

> **Individual 用言 can become a predicate all on their own, without any other words or modifiers.**

These are the three types of 用言:

1. <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (verbs) indicate
   _action_ or _existence._

   The plain form of these verbs always end with the う sound (〜う, 〜く, 〜す, 〜る, _etc._).

   Examples: <ruby>笑<rp>(</rp><rt>わら</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>う (to laugh),
   <ruby>動<rp>(</rp><rt>うご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く (to move).

2. <ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (so-called "い-adjectives")
   indicate nature or _state_ and end with the kana character い.

   Examples: <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white), <ruby>
   近<rp>(</rp><rt>ちか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-near).

   **IMPORTANT NOTE 1:**

   These examples are better thought of as "is-white" and "is-near" rather than
   just "white" and "near" (despite "meaning" the same thing to English
   speakers). 白い and 近い (with the い) are standalone words that act as 用言
   _and form a predicate all on their own._

   In English, "near" and "white" are _purely_ adjectives, not "verb-like" at
   all. They _only_ affect nouns on their own. To use them in a predicate, we'd
   have to _add_ a verb like "is", but _形容詞 in Japanese act as predicates all on
   their own._

   Japanese think of 形容詞 is primarily 用言 and only incidentally as
   "adjective-like". You should, too.

   But English speakers are usually taught that 形容詞 are primarily _adjectives_.
   They are taught that "い-adjectives" modify nouns, and that it's a _special case_ when they
   come at the end of a sentence!

   The author feels this causes confusion and leads to even advanced students
   uttering "eihongo" sentences like 「東京は近い**だ**」&mdash; that extra だ is
   grammatically wrong and _exactly_ equivalent to saying "Tokyo **is** is
   near" (with an extra "is").

   [Confusingly, appending です instead of だ, _is_ grammatical, but this really is
   a special case. Adding です after 形容詞 makes it a bit more polite, but
   is never required. Foreigners will be forgiven if they ignore this special case.]

   Thinking of 形容詞 words as meaning "is-◯" helps English speakers remember that
   they are verb-like words that can stand on their own in a predicate _as well as_
   describe nouns.

   **IMPORTANT NOTE 2:**

   The final い is _part of the word_, not an "い particle"! There is no such
   thing as an い particle. You aren't turning a word into a 形容詞 by adding い, the
   形容詞 _already has い as part of the word_.

   The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (white) is 名詞, a
   _noun_. You you might use it in a chess match, for example, to say things
   like 「白が<ruby>勝<rp>(</rp><rt>か</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>った」("white won").

   The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white) is 形容詞,
   _and is an entirely different word_.

   This is another reason the author believes it better to think of 白い as
   "is-white" rather than just "white". It helps to enforce the idea that it's a
   separate word on its own. Obviously they are _related_, but they are
   different words with different grammatical types. They _aren't_ the same word
   with い appended.

3. <ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (so-called
   "な-adjectives") indicate nature or state and end with the literal kana character
   だ.

   Examples: <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ (is-quiet),
   <ruby>大変<rp>(</rp><rt>たいへん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>だ (is-serious,
   is-grave)

   Again, think of these examples as "is-◯" rather than merely "quiet" or
   "serious/grave". You'll thank the author eventually if you start thinking this way now.

   形容動詞 function in a predicate exactly the same as 形容詞, except they end in
   だ rather than い. _Both_ indicate nature or state (as opposed to 動詞 which
   indicate action or existence).

   One technicality: unlike 形容詞, if you look up 形容動詞 in a dictionary they
   _won't_ usually include the だ. The dictionary will have an entry for 静か
   but probably not for 静かだ. 形容動詞 use だ for their primary purpose: when they are
   used as 用言 at the end of a sentence. But 形容動詞 use **な** in there
   alternate usage to modify nouns. (Unlike 形容詞 which _always_ include い for
   either purpose).

   Despite this technicality, you should still consider だ as part of the word
   rather than a separate "verb" like "is" (you would _never_ use the "stem" of
   a 形容動詞 on its own without だ or な).

Because Japanese grammar considers an explicit subject optional, <ruby>行<rp>(</rp><rt>い
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く, <ruby>寒<rp>(</rp><rt>さむ
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い, and <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ (a 動詞, 形容詞, and 形容動詞 respectively) are **complete** sentences!

### Non-inflectable words

There are five types of "non-inflectable" or "indeclinable" words (words that
_aren't_ primarily action or state).

4. 名詞 (nouns) Sub-types include pronouns, numbers, and counters.

   Examples: 新湯、森林

5. 副詞 (adverbs) modifiers for the three declinable types.

   Examples: 再び、とても

6. 連体詞 (definite article) These specify a specific person or thing the audience already
   knows, and modify the five indeclinable types.

   Examples: この、あやずる (this one, all of these)

7. 接続詞 (conjunctive, connective)

   Examples: また、しかし

8. 感動詞 (interjection)

   Examples: さあ、はい

### Auxiliary "words"

9. 助動詞 (auxiliary verb)

   Examples: 〜られる、〜ない

10. 助詞 (particle)

    Examples: 〜は、〜へ
