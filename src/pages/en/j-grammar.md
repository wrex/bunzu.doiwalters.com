Everything below is the _author's_ understanding of how Japanese grammar works.
Ultimately, this site presents an _opinion_. As the old joke goes: if you don't like
that opinion, he has others!

More seriously, mistakes are possible (likely, even). If you do disagree with
anything here, please let the author know. But please use evidence-based
reasoning rather than merely complaining with statements like "That's wrong!" or
"That's a confusing way to think about it".

Arguments are unlikely to sway the author's opinion unless the provide concrete examples
demonstrating errors or inconsistencies. Appeals to authority ("so-and-so says
_this_") are also less persuasive than evidence based reasoning.

Academic linguists study every language spoken on earth (and then some). They've
had to develop a sort of "meta-language" to describe the differences and
similarities across countless languages. (The author calls this meta-language
"linguistic-grammarian".) The words in this language have very specific
meanings and can be used to describe _any_ language.

Learning this meta-language is an incredibly difficult undertaking!

### For laymen not linguists

As a layman, trying to follow and understand two linguists describing
aspects of an unfamiliar language can be an exercise in frustration. The
conversations are full of arcane grammatical jargon and extremely nuanced points
that can be quite hard to grasp. ("It's all Greek to me" doesn't
begin to cover it!)

Fortunately, our needs are at least _slightly_ more modest: we only wish to diagram
sentences in _one_ language: Japanese.

Further, we _presume_ at least a basic level of Japanese language skills.
Specifically, readers should know at least a hundred or so simple Japanese words
and be able to construct _basic_ Japanese sentences. Readers should possess
something like a young, native child's capability in the language (but with
adult understanding of concepts).

We're also only diagramming structure (syntax), not meaning (semantics). One
doesn't need a deep, nuanced understanding of Japanese to make sense of these
diagrams, but the words themselves should help to explain the ideas displayed by
a diagram (how the words are used and what affects what).

As long as you can recognize "things" vs. "actions/existence" vs. "modifiers",
the diagrams should make some sense.

This _doesn't_ mean it's easy to _create_ accurate diagrams, though!

Japanese grammar and syntax is quite complex in its own right. It often differs
from English grammar in quite subtle ways.

Worse, explaining things in one language by using another can introduce all sorts of
unintended confusion. Like it or not, the languages we speak literally train
the neural pathways in our brains. We tend to "think" in our own languages even
when attempting to learn another (often causing confusion).

True fluency requires "thinking" in the target languages, something we hope to
encourage with these diagrams.

### Japanese terminology

While the diagrams themselves will _never_ contain any grammatical jargon in
either language, we are forced to use grammatical terminology to explain how
they are constructed.

Because English and Japanese grammatical terms can have subtly different
meanings, _this site always prefers the Japanese terms_! Whenever possible, we
also provide English equivalents or translations, but when the meanings differ,
no matter how subtly, we **always** intend the Japanese word and the Japanese
meaning.

The English word "noun" and the Japanese word <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> have pretty much identical meanings: "named things".

"Verb" and <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are also almost
identical. Both are terms for the parts of speech evoking action, state,
occurrence or change.

But the word "adjective" is a _completely_ different ballgame. For one thing, Japanese has
_two_ types of "adjectives": <ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> and <ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

Westerners typically call <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>,
<ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, and
<ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>

- "verbs",
- "い-adjectives",
- and ”な -adjectives"

respectively.

Japanese middle schools teach that:

> <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, <ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし
> </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, and <ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし
> </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are all <ruby>活用語
> <rp>(</rp><rt>かつようご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (conjugations) or
> <ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (inflections). They are
> all single words that describe action or state in the
> <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (predicate) of a sentence.

To a Japanese native, these words' ability to modify a noun is a
_secondary_ usage. Their primary use is to indicate action/state/utilization, as
opposed to things that _don't_ (like nouns, conjunctions, and interjections)

Don't believe it? Consider the following:

Japanese dictionaries call 形容動詞 **だ**-words, but we consider them to be
な-words! They think of them _first_ as verb-like (e.g. 「静かだ」&mdash; "it's
quiet"). We think of them as primarily adjective-like (e.g. 「静かな犬」&mdash; "[a]
quiet dog").

Most of us wouldn't think of verbs and adjectives as similar or
even related. In English grammar, "adjectives" modify nouns, and have almost
nothing to do with verbs! But _Japanese grammar doesn't behave like English._

That's why this site uses the Japanese terms whenever possible. The goal is to
_think about Japanese sentences like a Japanese native_ as much as possible.

### Why study grammar/syntax?

We all learned our native languages primarily by _immersion_ (repeated exposure
and mimicry). We didn't study grammar and "rules" until fairly late in our childhood.

The human brain is _incredibly_ well adapted to pattern matching. With
sufficient _input_ and practice, we _can_ reach even fairly advanced levels of
proficiency _without_ studying grammar.

_Nothing_ is more beneficial to learning a language than massive amounts of
_input_ (listening or reading) and constant practice (with feedback).

So why study grammar?

Eventually most countries force their schoolchildren to learn more about their
native languages. Students learn to think _about_ their native languages. Most
educated people eventually study grammar, composition, and classic literature at
some point.

The author believes this is beneficial and important (some might disagree!).

Learning the structure and nuances of our languages allows us to
communicate more effectively and to express more nuanced thoughts. The author
feels that "ungrammared" is almost as much an impediment to communication as
"illiterate".

While "he done it" would likely be understood, it sounds unrefined. In the
same way, 「その花がきれい！」 (without だ at the end) communicates an idea
effectively enough, but sounds jarring.

These diagrams provide a visual aid for reasoning about and composing with
grammatical syntax and structure. If you don't value grammar, then you
probably won't find sentence diagrams or this site terribly useful. (And you'd
be _wrong_. 😉)

### Learn like a native

This site attempts to teach Japanese grammatical syntax similar to how it would
be taught to Japanese <ruby>中学生<rp>(</rp><rt>ちゅうがくせい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(middle-school students).

("Attempts" being the key word. Much of the information is cribbed from [this
wonderful site about Japanese grammar](https://www.kokugobunpou.com/).)

Because this is a site for _foreign_ learners of Japanese, however, some
concessions and alterations will occasionally arise.

Whenever possible concepts are introduced in the same order as a _Japanese_
middle-school curriculum. The information is hierarchically organized using
_Japanese_ taxonomies. Concepts are described with as _Japanese_ a mindset as
the Author's English-native brain can provide.

### Only basics

This site only tries to explain how to diagram Japanese sentences.

It does _not_, repeat **NOT**, attempt to teach _everything_ about Japanese
grammar. We only present the high-level grammatical ideas relevant to
diagramming.

"Japanese grammar" is an extremely deep (and somewhat opinionated) subject!
Hopefully, these diagrams help people to reason about deeper topics not covered here.

## Units of Japanese writing

Japanese schoolteachers would teach these basic units or divisions of Japanese
writing, from largest to smallest:

- <ruby>文章<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんしょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> Used here to mean writing in
  general (a composition, essay, or, confusingly, mean an individual _sentence_.)

- <ruby>段落<rp>(</rp><rt>だんらく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> A paragraph. Literally, "falling
  rows" of text.

- <ruby>文<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> A sentence (that can be
  demarcated by a period.)

- <ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> An individual clause or phrase
  within a sentence.

- <ruby>単語<rp>(</rp><rt>たんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> An individual word.

We are only concerned with 文, 文節, and 単語 (sentences, clauses/phrase, and
words). In particular, identifying 文節 is the most critical part of diagramming.

## Parts of speech

If 文 are the "molecules" of Japanese, then 品詞 (parts of speech) are the atoms.

The character 詞, by the way, means a part of speech. They indicate that the
preceding word is a _grammatical type._

![Parts of speech diagram](/images/parts-of-speech-translated.png)

Most Japanese grammar resources refer to 八品詞, the "_eight_ parts of speech".

While there are only eight primary, or "freestanding" parts of speech, the
diagram above also includes two additional auxiliary or attached types
(interjections and particles).

### The ten types

#### 用言 declinable words

Technically, 用言 are "declinable" words. That's enough linguistic-grammarian.
These words _function_ as "utilization" words: they are the part of a predicate
that explains _what's happening_. English tends to focus on the _who_ and _what_
within a sentence, Japanese tends to focus on the _action_ or _state._

These words provide the latter.

Japanese is a predicate-centric language. The words at the end of a clause
(the predicate) tend to be the most important.

As shown at the top of the diagram, there are three types of "declinable," standalone words
that can become predicates all on their own (単独で述語となるもの).

> **Individual 用言 can become a predicate all on their own, without any other words or modifiers.**

Because Japanese grammar considers an explicit subject optional, 行く, 寒い, and 静かだ
are _all complete sentences._

These are the three types of 用言:

1. 動詞 (verbs) indicate _action_ or _existence._ The plain form of these verbs
   always end in う (more properly, something from the う column like く, す, ぬ,
   る, _etc._).

2. 形容詞 (so-called "い-adjectives") indicate nature or _state_ and end in い.

3. 形容動詞 (so-called "な-adjectives") indicate nature or state and end in だ.

#### 体言 indeclinable words

There are five types of "indeclinable words" (words that aren't primarily action
or state). Also known as "substantives".

4. 名詞 (nouns) Sub-types include pronouns, numbers, and counters.

5. 副詞 (adverbs) modifiers for the three declinable types.

6. 連体詞 (definite article) modifiers for the five indeclinable types.
   These specify a specific person or thing the audience already
   knows. Examples: これ、それ、あやずる (this, that, all)

7. 接続詞 (conjunctive, connective)

8. 感動詞 (interjection)

#### Auxiliary/attached words

9. 助動詞 (auxiliary verb)

10. 助詞 (particle)
