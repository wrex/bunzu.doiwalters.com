Academic linguists study every language spoken on earth (and then some). They've
had to develop a sort of "meta-language" in order to describe differences and
similarities across countless languages. The words they use have very specific
meanings and can be used to describe _any_ language.

That is an incredibly difficult undertaking!

As a layman, trying to follow and understand two linguists describing some
aspect of a language can be an exercise in frustration. The conversations are
full of arcane grammatical jargon and extremely nuanced meanings. It can be
quite hard to understand. ("It's all Greek to me" doesn't begin to cover it!)

Fortunately, our needs are _slightly_ more modest: we only wish to diagram
sentences in _one_ language: Japanese.

Further, we _presume_ a base level understanding of simple Japanese words and
how to construct _basic_ Japanese sentences. Again, we're only diagramming
structure (syntax), not meaning (semantics).

This _doesn't_ mean it's easy, though! Japanese grammar and syntax is quite
complex in it's own right. It also differs from English grammar in often quite subtle
ways.

Worse, this site uses the author's native language, English, to explain how to
create these diagrams.

Explaining things in one language by using another can introduce all sorts of
unintended confusion. Like it or not, the languages we speak literally train
the neural pathways in our brains. We tend to "think" in our own languages even
when attempting to learn another.

True fluency requires "thinking" in the target languages.

## Grammar Vocabulary (文法の語彙)

While the diagrams themselves will _never_ contain any grammatical jargon, we
are forced to use grammatical terminology to explain how they are constructed.

Because English and Japanese grammatical terms can have subtly different
meanings, _this site always uses the Japanese terms_! Whenever possible, an
English equivalent or translation will also be given, but when the meanings
differ, no matter how subtly, the Japanese word and the Japanese meaning is
**always** what is intended.

The English word "noun" and the Japanese word <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> have pretty much identical meanings: "named things".

But "adjective" is a completely different ballgame. For one thing, Japanese has
_two_ types of "adjectives": <ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> and <ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>. Even more confusingly, Japanese natives are taught that
these things primarily exist in the _predicate_ of a sentence &mdash; they think
of them more like _verbs_!

To a Japanese native, an "adjective"'s ability to modify a noun is a
secondary, alternate usage. Their primary purpose is _to end a Japanese
sentence_.

That's why this site uses the Japanese terms whenever possible. The goal is to
_think about Japanese sentences like a Japanese native._
