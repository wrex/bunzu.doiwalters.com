Academic linguists study every language spoken on earth (and then some). They've
had to develop a sort of "meta-language" in order to describe differences and
similarities across countless languages. The words they use have very specific
meanings and can be used to describe _any_ language.

That is an incredibly difficult undertaking!

### For layman not linguists

As a layman, trying to follow and understand two linguists describing some
aspect of an unfamiliar language can be an exercise in frustration. The
conversations are full of arcane grammatical jargon and extremely nuanced
meanings. It can be quite hard to understand. ("It's all Greek to me" doesn't
begin to cover it!)

Fortunately, our needs are _slightly_ more modest: we only wish to diagram
sentences in _one_ language: Japanese.

Further, we _presume_ a base level Japanese understanding. Specifically, readers
should know at least a hundred or so simple Japanese words and
at least be able to construct _basic_ Japanese sentences.

Again, we're only diagramming structure (syntax), not meaning (semantics). One
doesn't need deep nuanced understanding of Japanese to make sense of these diagrams.

This _doesn't_ mean it's easy, though! Japanese grammar and syntax is quite
complex in it's own right. It also differs from English grammar in often quite subtle
ways.

Worse, this site uses the author's native language, English, to explain how to
create these diagrams.

Explaining things in one language by using another can introduce all sorts of
unintended confusion. Like it or not, the languages we speak literally train
the neural pathways in our brains. We tend to "think" in our own languages even
when attempting to learn another.

True fluency requires "thinking" in the target languages (more on this below).

### Japanese terminology

While the diagrams themselves will _never_ contain any grammatical jargon, we
are forced to use grammatical terminology to explain how they are constructed.

Because English and Japanese grammatical terms can have subtly different
meanings, _this site always uses the Japanese terms_! Whenever possible, we also
provide English equivalents or translations, but when the meanings differ, no
matter how subtly, we **always** intend the Japanese word and the Japanese
meaning.

The English word "noun" and the Japanese word <ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> have pretty much identical meanings: "named things".

"Verb" and <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are also almost
identical. Both are terms for the parts of speech evoking action, state,
occurrence or change.

But the word "adjective" is a _completely_ different ballgame. For one thing, Japanese has
_two_ types of "adjectives": <ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> and <ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

Westerners typically call <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>,
<ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, and
<ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>

- "verbs",
- "い-adjectives",
- and ”な -adjectives"

respectively.

Japanese middle schools teach that:

> <ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, <ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし
> </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, and <ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし
> </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are all <ruby>活用語
> <rp>(</rp><rt>かつようご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (conjugations) or
> <ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (inflections). They are
> all single words that describe action or state in the
> <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (predicate) of a sentence.

To a Japanese native, these "adjective"'s ability to modify a noun is a
_secondary_ usage. Their primary use is to provide a sense of
utilization/action/state as distinct from things that _don't_ confer any sense of
utilization, action or state (like nouns, conjunctions, and interjections)

Note that Japanese consider 形容動詞 to be **だ**-words, but we consider them to be
な-words! They think of them as primarily verb-like (e.g. 「静かだ」&mdash;
"it's quiet"). We think of them as primarily adjective-like (e.g. 「静かな犬」&mdash; "[a] quiet dog").

Most of us wouldn't think of verbs and adjectives as similar or
even related. In English grammar, "adjectives" modify nouns, and have almost
nothing to do with verbs! But Japanese doesn't behave like English.

That's one example of why this site uses the Japanese terms whenever possible. The goal is to
_think about Japanese sentences like a Japanese native._

### Why study grammar/syntax?

We all learned our native languages primarily by _immersion_ (repeated exposure
and mimicry). We didn't study grammar and "rules" until fairly late in our childhood.

The human brain is _incredibly_ well adapted to pattern matching. Nothing is
more beneficial to learning a language than massive amounts of _input_ (listening
or reading) and constant practice (with feedback).

But eventually most schoolchildren are forced to learn more about their native
languages, to think _about_ their native languages. Most of us eventually study
grammar, and composition, and classic literature at some point.

The author feels this is beneficial and important (some disagree!).

Learning the structure and nuances of our languages allows us to
communicate more effectively and to express more nuanced thoughts. The author
feels that "ungrammared" is almost as much an impediment to communication as
"illiterate".

Regardless, these diagrams are a visual aid for reasoning about grammatical
syntax and structure. If you've no interest in the latter, the you probably
won't find sentence diagrams useful.

### Learn like a native

This site attempts to teach Japanese grammatical syntax in the same way it would
be taught to Japanese <ruby>中学生<rp>(</rp><rt>ちゅうがくせい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
(middle-school students).

("Attempts" being the key word. Much of the information is cribbed from [this
wonderful Japanese language site](https://www.kokugobunpou.com/).)

Because this is a site for _foreign_ learners of Japanese, some concessions will
be inevitable, but whenever possible concepts are introduced in the same order
as a _Japanese_ middle-school curriculum. The information is hierarchically
organized using _Japanese_ taxonomies. Concepts are described with as _Japanese_
a mindset as the Author's English-native brain can provide.

This site does _not_, repeat **NOT**, attempt to teach _everything_ about Japanese
grammar. The focus is on sentence diagrams. We only present "intermediate" topics
relevant to diagramming.

## Grammatical terms (文法の語彙)

Japanese schoolteachers would teach these basic units or divisions of Japanese
writing, from largest to smallest:

- <ruby>文章<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんしょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> Used here to mean writing in
  general (a composition, essay, or, confusingly, mean an individual _sentence_.)

- <ruby>段落<rp>(</rp><rt>だんらく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> A paragraph. Literally, "falling
  rows" of text.

- <ruby>文<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> A sentence (that can be
  demarcated by a period.)

- <ruby>文節<rp>(</rp><rt>ぶんせつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> An individual clause or phrase
  within a sentence.

- <ruby>単語<rp>(</rp><rt>たんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> An individual word.

We are only concerned with 文, 文節, and 単語 (sentences, clauses/phrase, and
words). In particular, identifying 文節 is the most critical part of diagramming.

### Clauses: 主語 and 述語

Every fully-formed 文 (sentence) contains at least one 文節 (clause). Many only
have one, but complex sentences might have many.

**Every** clause comprises exactly two parts:

> **Important Rule #1:**
>
> _Every_ clause **always** has a <ruby>主語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
> (subject) and <ruby>述語<rp>(</rp><rt>じゅつご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
> (predicate)!

These two parts form the framework of every clause.

The 主語 answers _who_ or _what_. The character 主 provides a clue: it means
"master". The 主語 is the "master" of the clause performing an action or simply
existing in some state of being. The 主語 is usually identified by the
<ruby>助詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (particle) が.

One major point of confusion for foreign learners is that the 主語 is often
_omitted_ in speech or writing. More accurately, it's _implied_ from prior context.

> **Important rule #2:**
>
> 主語 are often _omitted_ in writing or speech, but something **always** acts
> as the "master" in **every** clause. Many foreign learners find it easier to
> imagine a "zero pronoun" when the 主語 is omitted (to be discussed later).

The 述語 specifies _what is done,_ or _how, in what way_, it's done. It comes
at the end of the clause.

> **Important rule #3:**
>
> 述語 are **always** at the very end of a clause.

Example:

> <ruby>鳥<rp>(</rp><rt>とり</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　が　<ruby>鳴<rp>(</rp><rt>な</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く
> ("[the] bird chirps")

The 主語 in this sentence is 鳥 (bird). The 述語 is 鳴く(to chirp).

In addition to the 主語 and 述語, there are three other functional components
that can appear in 文節:

#### 修飾語

<ruby>修飾語<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅうしょくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _modifiers_
or qualifiers affecting something else.

For example, in the (subjectless) clause:

> ゆっくり 歩く ("Walk slowly")

the word ゆっくり (slowly) is 修飾語 (a modifer) and <ruby>歩<rp>(</rp><rt>ある
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く (to walk) is the 述語.

#### 接続語

<ruby>接続語<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _conjunctives_
that connect clauses.

For example:

> 安いのに、おいしい ("Even though [it's] cheap, [it's] delicious")

Here, のに ("even though") is 接続語 (a connective or conjunctive) between two
different (single word) clauses: <ruby>安<rp>(</rp><rt>やす
</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い ("cheap") and おいしい ("delicious").

Note that _both_ clauses have "omitted" the subject. It's actually the same implied
subject in both clauses (whatever food they are talking about).

#### 独立語

<ruby>独立語<rp>(</rp><rt>どくりつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> are _independent,
standalone_ words (interjections and exclamations).

The serve almost no functional/structural purpose. We can mostly ignore them
when it comes to diagramming.

Example:

> さあ、やろう ("C'mon! Let's go")

The word さあ ("C'mon", "well", "Allright") is 独立語 a standalone word. The
real clause (again subject-less) is やろう ("Let [us] go").
