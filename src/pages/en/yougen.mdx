## Three types of <ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>

As described previously, most J-E dictionaries call 用言 "inflectable" or
"declinable" words, but most people don't really know what those words mean,
either.

A better definition, in the author's opinion, for 用言 might be:

> **用言**: Words that describe what's going on with the _subject_ in a sentence. These
> words form the _predicate_ of a sentence and describe the action, existence,
> nature, or state of the _subject_. The character 用 means how something is
> used or serviced.

Japanese is a predicate-centric language. The words at the end of a clause
(the predicate) tend to be the most important.

As shown at the top of the parts-of-speech diagram, there are three types of
"inflectable," standalone words that can become predicates all on their own
(in Japanese: 単独で述語となるもの).

<Admonition title="Note">
  Remember: All three types of 用言 can become a predicate all on their own,
  without any other words or modifiers.
</Admonition>

To recap, the three types of 用言 are:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1. <strong><ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (verbs) indicate _action_ or _existence._

   The plain form of these verbs always end with the う sound (〜う, 〜く, 〜す, 〜る, _etc._).

   Examples: <ruby>笑<rp>(</rp><rt>わら</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>う (to laugh), <ruby>動<rp>(</rp><rt>うご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く (to move).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
2. <strong><ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (so-called "い-adjectives") indicate nature or _state_ and end with the kana character い.

    Examples: <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white), <ruby>近<rp>(</rp><rt>ちか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-near).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
3. <strong><ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (so-called "な-adjectives") indicate nature or state and end with the literal kana character だ.

      Note that some 形容動詞 have a stem that ends with い. This can make it
      difficult for learners to remember which is which. For example, the word
      きれい (pretty) is 形容動詞, not a 形容詞 despite ending with い. It's the _stem_ of きれいだ
      (is-pretty). There is no rule or trick to recognizing these, just rote memorization.

      Examples: <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ (is-quiet), <ruby> 大変<rp>(</rp> <rt>たいへん</rt> <rp>)</rp> </ruby> だ (is-serious, is-grave)

## "is-verbs" not "adjectives"

Note the form of the English translations. They include, for example, "is-white"
and "is-quiet", not just "white" and "quiet".

_Japanese grammarians consider 形容詞 and 形容動詞 more like "is-verbs" than as adjectives!_

To an English speaker, "is-white" and "is-quiet" _mean_ the same thing as just
"white" and "quiet". But thinking of them as "is-verbs" rather than adjectives
helps us to think like Japanese natives.

Remember: to a Japanese, the two "first class" categories of words are 用言
(predicate words) and 体言 (subject/object) words. These roughly correlate to
verbs and nouns in English.

To a Japanese native, 白い and 静かだ (with the い and だ included) are _standalone
words_ that act as 用言 _and can form a predicate all on their own._ They aren't
second-class words that merely _modify_ or _qualify_ 体言. They are _first-class_ parts of
speech that form _predicates_.

In contrast, the English word "white," for example, is either an adjective or a noun. It isn't
"verb-like" at all. To use it in a predicate, we'd have to _add_ a verb like
"is": "[It] is white".

But _形容詞 and 形容動詞 act as predicates all on their own._ That's why
thinking of them as compound words ("is-white", for example) is advantageous.

Japanese natives think of these word-types as primarily 用言, and only incidentally as
"adjective-like". You should, too.

The author feels this flip-flopped style of instruction (calling them
"adjectives" rather than "is verbs") causes confusion and leads
to students uttering "eihongo" sentences like 「東京は近い**だ**」&mdash;
that extra だ is grammatically wrong and _exactly_ equivalent to saying "Tokyo
**is** is near" (with an extra "is").[^1]

[^1]:
    Either Cure Dolly or Proffessor Rubin likely coined the word "Eihongo" as
    the inverse of "Japlish". It means funny-sounding Japanese that immediately
    exposes a non-native speaker.

Thinking of 形容詞 words as meaning "is-◯" helps English speakers remember
that they are verb-like words that can stand on their own in a predicate _as
well as_ describe nouns.

<Admonition title="Warning">

There is however, one irritating point of confusion.

For the most part, だ and です are pretty much interchangeable. The latter
is basically a more polite form of the former.

But it's _always_ wrong to append だ to the end of a sentence that uses a 形容詞
as the predicate:

- 犬が白い (grammatically correct, equivalent to "[the] dog is-white")

- ~~犬が白い**だ**~~ (_incorrect_ grammar!)

Confusingly, though, appending です instead of だ, _is_ grammaticallly correct:

- 犬が白いです (grammatically correct, equivalent to a politer version of "[the] dog is-white")

This really is a special case. Adding です after 形容詞 at the end of a sentence
makes it more polite, but it is grammatically weird.

Like all human languages, Japanese grammar has occasionally weird inconsistencies like this.

## There is no い particle

The final い in 形容詞 is _part of the word_, not an "い particle"! There is no such
thing as an い particle.

You aren't turning a word into a 形容詞 by adding い, the 形容詞 _already has い as part
of the word_.

The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (white) is 名詞, a
_noun_. You you might use it in a chess match, for example, to say things
like 「白が<ruby>勝<rp>(</rp><rt>か</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>った」("white won").

The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white) is 形容詞,
_and is an entirely different word_ than 白.

This is another reason the author believes it better to think of 白い as
"is-white" rather than just "white". It helps to reenforce the idea that it's a
separate word on its own. Obviously they are _related_, but they are
different words with different grammatical types. They _aren't_ the same word
with い appended.

<Admonition title="Warning">

One more technicality.

Unlike 形容詞, dictionary entries for 形容動詞 _won't_ usually include the だ. The
dictionary will have an entry for 静か but probably not for 静かだ.

Technically, **だ and な appended to 形容動詞 _are_ 助詞 (particles),** but い
appended to 形容詞 is not.

形容詞 _always_ include い whether ending a sentence or modifying something else, so
the dictionary entries _include_ the い as part of the word. The い is _not_ a particle.

形容動詞 use **だ** for their primary purpose (when they are used as 用言 at the end of a
sentence), but **な** for their alternate usage (to modify nouns). So both _are_
considered particles.

There are two ways だ can be used at the end of a sentence:

- As _part of_ a 形容動詞 (as described above)

- After a 名詞 or something acting like a noun. In this case だ is actually an
  助動詞, an _auxiliary-verb_, meaning "is".

It's best to "think of" だ as part of a 形容動詞 at the end of a sentence. It's
_not_ a separate "verb" like "is".

Grammatical Japanese sentences don't normally use the "stem" of a 形容動詞 on their
own _without_ だ or な. Someone exclaiming「静か」would be understood, but it
sounds unfinished. Do they mean "it is quiet" or "that's a quiet thing"?

Western grammarians tend to think of 形容動詞 as "nominalizing" adjectives. They
think of the stem form as a special sort of noun, and think of だ as a
verb. While this way of thinking mostly "works" it simply isn't how
it's taught in Japan. In Japanese dictionaries, だ is a particle.

</Admonition>

Because Japanese grammar considers an explicit subject optional,

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>行<rp>(</rp><rt>い </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>寒<rp>(</rp><rt>さむ </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ

(a 動詞, 形容詞, and 形容動詞 respectively) are **complete** sentences!
