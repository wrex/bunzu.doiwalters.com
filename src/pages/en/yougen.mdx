### <ruby>用言<rp>(</rp><rt>ようげん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> "inflectable" words

Most J-E dictionaries call 用言 "inflectable" or "declinable" words, but
most people don't really know what those words mean, either.

A better definition, in the author's opinion, for 用言 might be:

> **用言**: Words that describe what's going on with the _subject_ in a sentence. These
> words form the _predicate_ of a sentence and describe the action, existence,
> nature, or state of the _subject_. The character 用 means how something is
> used or serviced.

Japanese is a predicate-centric language. The words at the end of a clause
(the predicate) tend to be the most important.

As shown at the top of the diagram, there are three types of "inflectable,"
standalone words that can become predicates all on their own (単独で述語となるもの).

<Admonition title="Note">
  Individual 用言 can become a predicate all on their own, without any other
  words or modifiers.
</Admonition>

These are the three types of 用言:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
1. <strong><ruby>動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>どうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (verbs) indicate _action_ or _existence._

   The plain form of these verbs always end with the う sound (〜う, 〜く, 〜す, 〜る, _etc._).

   Examples: <ruby>笑<rp>(</rp><rt>わら</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>う (to laugh), <ruby>動<rp>(</rp><rt>うご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く (to move).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
2. <strong><ruby>形容詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (so-called "い-adjectives") indicate nature or _state_ and end with the kana character い.

    Examples: <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white), <ruby>近<rp>(</rp><rt>ちか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-near).

<Admonition title="Important note #1">
These examples are better thought of as "is-white" and "is-near" rather than
just "white" and "near" (despite "meaning" the same thing to English
speakers). 白い and 近い (with the い) are standalone words that act as 用言
_and form a predicate all on their own._

In English, "white," for example, is either an adjective or a noun. It isn't
"verb-like" at all. To use it in a predicate, we'd have to _add_ a verb like
"is": "[It] is white".

But _形容詞 in Japanese act as predicates all on their own._

Japanese natives think of 形容詞 is primarily 用言 and only incidentally as
"adjective-like". You should, too.

But English speakers are usually taught that 形容詞 are primarily
_adjectives_. They are taught that "い-adjectives" modify nouns, and that it's
a _special case_ when they come at the end of a sentence!

The author feels this causes confusion and leads to even advanced students
uttering "eihongo" sentences like 「東京は近い**だ**」&mdash; that extra だ is
grammatically wrong and _exactly_ equivalent to saying "Tokyo **is** is near"
(with an extra "is").

[Confusingly, appending です instead of だ, _is_ grammatical, but this really
is a special case. Adding です after 形容詞 makes it a bit more polite, but is
never required. Foreigners will be forgiven if they ignore this special case.]

Thinking of 形容詞 words as meaning "is-◯" helps English speakers remember
that they are verb-like words that can stand on their own in a predicate _as
well as_ describe nouns.

</Admonition>

<Admonition title="IMPORTANT NOTE 2">
The final い is _part of the word_, not an "い particle"! There is no such
thing as an い particle. You aren't turning a word into a 形容詞 by adding い, the
形容詞 _already has い as part of the word_.

The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> (white) is 名詞, a
_noun_. You you might use it in a chess match, for example, to say things
like 「白が<ruby>勝<rp>(</rp><rt>か</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>った」("white won").

The word <ruby>白<rp>(</rp><rt>しろ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い (is-white) is 形容詞,
_and is an entirely different word_.

This is another reason the author believes it better to think of 白い as
"is-white" rather than just "white". It helps to reenforce the idea that it's a
separate word on its own. Obviously they are _related_, but they are
different words with different grammatical types. They _aren't_ the same word
with い appended.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
3. <strong><ruby>形容動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>けいようどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (so-called "な-adjectives") indicate nature or state and end with the literal kana character だ.

      Examples: <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ (is-quiet), <ruby> 大変<rp>(</rp> <rt>たいへん</rt> <rp>)</rp> </ruby> だ (is-serious, is-grave)

      Again, think of these examples as "is-◯" rather than merely "quiet" or
      "serious/grave". You'll thank the author eventually if you start thinking this way now.

      形容動詞 function in a predicate exactly the same as 形容詞, except they end in
      だ rather than い. _Both_ indicate nature or state (as opposed to 動詞 which
      indicate action or existence).

<Admonition title="One technicality">
Unlike 形容詞, dictionary entries for 形容動詞 _won't_ usually include the だ. The
dictionary will likely have an entry for 静か but probably not for 静かだ.

This is because 形容動詞 use **だ** for their primary purpose (when they are used as 用言 at the end of a
sentence), but **な** for their alternate usage (to modify nouns).

形容詞 which _always_ include い for _either_ purpose, so the dictionary entries
include the い.

Despite this technicality, you should still consider だ as part of the word
rather than a separate "verb" like "is" (you would never use the "stem" of
a 形容動詞 on its own _without_ だ or な).

</Admonition>

Because Japanese grammar considers an explicit subject optional,

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>行<rp>(</rp><rt>い </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>く

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>寒<rp>(</rp><rt>さむ </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>い

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <ruby>静<rp>(</rp><rt>しず </rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>かだ

(a 動詞, 形容詞, and 形容動詞 respectively) are **complete** sentences!

### Non-inflectable words

There are five types of "non-inflectable" or "indeclinable" words (words that
_aren't_ primarily action or state).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
4. <strong><ruby>名詞<rp>(</rp><rt>めいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (nouns) Sub-types include pronouns, numbers, and counters.

      Examples: 新湯、森林

{/* prettier-ignore */}
5. <strong><ruby>副詞<rp>(</rp><rt>ふくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (adverbs) modifiers for the three declinable types.

      Examples: 再び、とても

{/* prettier-ignore */}
6. <strong><ruby>連体詞<rp>(</rp><rt>れんたいし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (definite article) These specify a specific person or thing the audience already
knows, and modify the five indeclinable types.

      Examples: この、あやずる (this one, all of these)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
7. 接続詞 (conjunctive, connective)

      Examples: また、しかし

{/* prettier-ignore */}
8. <strong><ruby>接続詞<rp>(</rp><rt>せつぞくし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (interjection)

      Examples: さあ、はい

### Auxiliary "words"

{/* prettier-ignore */}
9. <strong><ruby>感動詞<rp>(</rp><rt>かんどうし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (auxiliary verb)

      Examples: 〜られる、〜ない

{/* prettier-ignore */}
10. <strong><ruby>助詞<rp>(</rp><rt>じょし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></strong> (particle)

    Examples: 〜は、〜へ
