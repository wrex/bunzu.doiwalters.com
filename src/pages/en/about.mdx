This site was created by Rex Walters (username `rrwrex` on
[community.wanikani.com](https://community.wanikani.com)).

It was inspired by a thread on the [Wanikani community
forum](https://community.wanikani.com) that mentioned another grammatical
diagramming technique called ["tree
diagrams"](https://blog.ung.edu/press/a-linguists-tree-of-knowledge/).

He found tree diagrams difficult to create and understand because they depended
heavily on technical grammatical jargon.

But they reminded him of how much he enjoyed creating [sentence
diagrams](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/sentence-diagramming/) in primary
school. He wondered if it wouldn't be possible to create something similar for
Japanese that.

The goal was to create something similar. Something that made the internal
structure of Japanese sentences visible, without relying on technical jargon.

## About the author

Rex is a US Navy brat who's first exposure to Japan was in the mid 1970's when
his father moved the family to Hayama in Kanagawa prefecture. He's now married
to a Japanese native with three completely bilingual adult children (two of whom
currently reside in Japan).

Although he's been speaking Japanese (poorly) for many years, thanks to
[Wanikani](https://wanikani.com) he's recently learned how to _read_ the
language. It turns out that being illiterate was holding him back (who could
have known?).

Rex can be reached at rw@pobox.com.
